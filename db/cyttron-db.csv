"Enlargement of the temporal horn (also called inferior horn) of the lateral ventricles 1, 2. This enlargement can either be symmetric as well as asymmetric. The higher the rates of ventricular enlargement are in healthy persons, the greater is relative hazard for AD3, 4. When examining the volume of the temporal horn, age should be taken into account, because the size of the temporal horn increases with increasing age 5.
Yearly measurements of  the temporal horn in alzheimer patients have shown a 14.16 /-8.47 percentage increase per year (p = 0.002)6. 
Enlargement of the temporal horn is caused by atrophy in the hippocampal, amygdala and entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in the temporal lobe.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"volumetry, enlargment, aging, Atrophy in: hippocampus, Amygdala,Amydala-hippocampal complex,	Enthorhinal cortex, Perirhinal cortex,  parahippocampus"

"Atrophy in perirhinal cortex is seen in Alzheimer patiens. Different experiments show that perirhinal damage result in cognitive impairment, a symptom that is prominent in alzheimer disease 22-24. 
A decrease of volume of 21-42 percentage can be found in alzheimer patients compared t controls 9, 19. Volumetric measurements of the perirhinal cortex have a sensitivity of  73- 85 percentage and a specificity of 62-81 percentage 9, 19. The difference in specificity differs between left and right entorhinal cortices9.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"atrophy, volumetry, cognitive impairment, cerebral atrophy, diagnostics"
"Atrophy in the entorhinal cortex is seen in Alzheimer patients{Teipel, 2006 23 /id}. A reduction of this structure can found between 24-40 % 9, 13, 19-21 in Alzheimer patients compared to controls. Different experiments show that ERC damage result in cognitive impairment 22-24. 
A higher volume loss is found in female compared to male Alzheimer patients. Atrophy of the enthorhinal cortex is also seen in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)25. 
Volumetric measurement of the entorhinal cortex resulted in better diagnostic accuracy because pathology in these structures occur at an earlier stage than in the amygdale or hippocampus9, although some studies showed a more accurate or equal discrimination by hippocampal volumetric measurements 13,15. However some studies showed a superior diagnostic accuracy for entorhinal cortex compared to hippocampal measurements in preclinical AD and patients at risk for AD compare to controls 26, 27. 

In clinical practice hippocampal volumetry has less variability and is easier to use compared to entorhinal measurements.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"atrophy, volumetry, cognitive impairment, cerebral atrophy, diagnostics"
"Since AD is associated with a decrease in memory function and the hippocampus might play a role in memory function, researchers focussed on the degeneration of the hippocampus. Bilateral hippocamal atrophy is found in the brains of Alzheimer patients9. Reduction of the hippocampus for diagnosing is measured in two different ways. By using volumetry of the hippocampus itself or by using volumetry of the AHC (amygdale hippocampal complex).
Volumetric studies of the hippocampus showed a reduction of 25 -39% 10,11,12. When measuring relative size in relation to the total cranial volume even a bigger reduction is found of 45%10. Yearly measurements of hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer patients showed a 3.98 /-1.92% decrease per year (p < 0.001)6. Patients with severe AD disease show higher atrophy rates compared to early or mild AD10,11. 
Correlations are found between hippocampal atrophy and severity of dementia, age 11and sex. Because a correlation is found between age and hippocampal atrophy, volumetric changes should be correct for age and sex. 

For clinical diagnoses it still remains uncertain whether volumetric measurements of the hippocampus alone is the most accurate way, some studies imply so 12. For diagnosing AD by hippocampal volume measurements the sensitivity varies between 77% and 95% and a specificity of 71-92% 9, 11-14. 

The sensitivity and specificity varies due the variance of patients and controls used. Patients varies in severity of disease and controls in these studies included FTP, MCI or non-alzheimer elderly. 

Other studies found that diagnosis based on volumetric changes are comparable for the hippocampus and ERC, but due the more easier use and less variability of hippocampal volumetry, the hippocampus is more feasible for diagnosis 13, 15.  Other studies found that combinations of different volumetric measurements with parahippocampal cortex, ERC14or amygdale (see AHC)  are indeed needed for a more accurate diagnosis of AD patients. AD has some similar atrophic regions compared to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), therefore volumetry of the ERC in combination with hippocampal volumetry can give a more accurate diagnosis of AD 14.


Total intracranial volume (TIV) and temporal horn indices (THI:  ratio of THV to lateral ventricular volume) can be used as surrogate marker for volume loss of hippocampal formation. A negative correlation is found between THI and THV and the declarative reminding test 16.

Some studies indicate that the accuracy of AD diagnosis increases by volumetry of amygdala-hippocampal complex (AHC) compared to only volumetric measurements of the hippocampus 10";"Fill in your group notes here.";"atrophy, volumetry, decreased memory function, cerebral atrophy, amygdala hippocampal complex"

The cartoon also shows that large ducts selectively proliferate in response to BDL following acute CCl4 administration. Apoptosis was observed only in large cholangiocytes and this was accompanied by loss of function with decreased proliferation and secretion in large cholangiocytes and loss of the choleretic effect of secretin. Concomitant with loss of large duct functions, small cholangiocytes proliferate de novo and respond to secretin to compensate for loss of function of large ducts after CCl4 administration.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

"Three-way correlation in a 26-month-old mouse with Alzheimerâs disease (AD). Panels A, C, and E are full field of view (FOV), and panels B, D, and F illustrate a magnified subsampled area centered on the hippocampus of the parent image to its left. The numbered arrows point to identical spatial coordinate positions in the common space of the three spatially registered volumes (in vivo, ex vivo, histological) using a linked cursor system. Spatially matched in vivo (A, B), ex vivo (C, D), and histological sections (E, F) conclusively demonstrate that the dark areas seen in vivo do indeed represent plaques. (E) Scale bar = 500 um. (F) Scale bar = 200 um. Plaque sharpness in vivo approaches but is clearly inferior to that obtained on ex vivo magnetic resonance microimaging (MRMI).";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

"Transport of mitochondria into neurites
of differentiated neuroblastoma cells is impaired
by overexpression of tau. Tau40-stable
(aÃc) and mock-transfected N2a cells (dÃf) were
differentiated for 2 d by addition of 1 mM retinoic acid into medium containing 0.1% fetal
calf serum and fixed in methanol. Mitochondria
were visualized with MitoTrackerÂª Green (a and d), immunostaining was done with antibodies
against tubulin (b and e) and tau (c and
f). It can be clearly seen that significantly fewer mitochondria are present in the neurites of taustable cells in contrast to control cells (compare a and d, and Table I). In addition, mitochondria in tau-stable cells appear to be more clustered in the vicinity of the MTOC (a), similar to tau-stable CHO cells. The comparable staining intensity of the cell bodies indicates that the clustering effect is not due to a lower number of mitochondria in the tau-transfected cell.

"The expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum in differentiated neuroblastoma cells is significantly reduced by overexpression of tau. Tau-stable N2a cells (aÃc) or  ock-transfected cells (dÃf) were induced to differentiate, and then fixed in  araformaldehyde and triple-labeled with antibodies against the ER (a and d), tubulin (b and e), and tau (c and f). In contrast to control cells, z82% of tau-stable neuroblastoma cells show the ER clustered at one side of the nucleus (a), whereas in mock-transfected cells the ER surrounds the entire nucleus (d; compare Table I). Furthermore, the expansion of the ER into the neurites in control cells (d) can clearly be seen. In tau-stable cells, only a faint signal of ER-immunoreactivity is visible in neuritic processes. The total intensity of the ER stain is the same in both cells. Arrowheads in a and d are indicating the position of the neurite relative to the cell body.

Cells were fixed in methanol 30 min after addition of Mito-
TrackerÂª Green. In tau-stable cells (aÃc), there is a striking clustering of mitochondria near the MTOC (seen near the nucleus where the microtubule stain is most intense), whereas in mocktransfected cells (dÃf) the mitochondria are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. In addition, the tau-stable cells are more rounded up compared with control cells. Bar, 20 mm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Effects of different tau constructs on mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells. Mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells stably transfected with different tau constructs was examined after paraformaldehyde fixation. This allows the visualization of total tau in the cells, but tends to dissociate tau from the microtubules (see Materials and Methods). Human tau23, the shortest tau-isoform (a and b), as well as K35 (c and d), a tau construct lacking nearly the entire projection domain (see Fig. 1) both led to the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering near the MTOC as seen in tau40-stable cells. On the other hand, K23 (e and f), a tau construct lacking the microtubule-binding region and K12 (g and h), consisting mainly of this MT-binding region (Fig. 1), did not alter the distribution of mitochondria. This argues for a tight binding of tau to microtubules as a prerequisite for impairment of plus-endÃdirected transport of these organelles and excludes the possibility that tau might inhibit kinesin by directly interacting with the motor protein. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTrackerÂª Red (a, c, e, and g) and transfected tau with polyclonal antiÃtau antibody K9JA (b, d, f, and h).

Âª Red (a and b), cells were fixed with araformaldehyde and stained with antibodies against tubulin (c and d) and tau (e and f). Mitochondrial clustering is visible even within 4 h after microinjection. Note that the microtubule network retains its normal appearance and that mitochondria in microinjected cells similar as in the tau-stable CHO and N2a cells tend to cluster
at one side of the nucleus in the vicinity of the MTOC. The cell periphery of microinjected cells is outlined for clarity. Bar,10 mm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

of tau-transfected CHO cells was disrupted by addition of 5 mM nocodazole for 3 h. Pictures of living cells were then taken after removal
of nocodazole and reassembly of microtubules
at the indicated time points. Mitochondria were
stained with MitoTrackerÂª green. Note that, concomitant with microtubule reassembly, the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering at the MTOC near the nucleus begins to reappear after z1 h.

"Randomization of microtubule polarity by taxotere allows clustered mitochondria to disperse again. Tau-stable cells were treated with 10 mM taxotere for 6 h, which leads to an altered microtubule organization. Note that the MTOC in taxotere-
treated cells is barely visible in the tubulin stain (b), in contrast to nontreated cells (compare Fig. 2). Microtubules are nucleated randomly throughout the cytoplasm, thus abolishing
the role of the MTOC as an organizing element and therefore abolishing the polarity of microtubules. Minus-endÃdirected motors
are now able to transport mitochondria back to peripheral regions in the tau-stable cells. Cells were fixed in methanol and mitochondria were stained with MitoTrackerÂª Green (a), tubulin
was immunostained with DM1A (b). Bar, 10 mm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

The entorhinal cortex is located inframedially on the surface of the brain. It is fused with the subiculum of the hippocampus medially and extends to the rhinal sulcus laterally. The entorhinal cortex was outlined on three consecutive normalized coronal images centered at the level of the mammillary bodies. The outline of the region began at the angle formed by the junction of the rhinal sulcus and the surface of the brain (the posterior end of this region may be continuous with the collateral sulcus in some subjects). The outline then transected this angle, cutting across the gray matter to the level of the white matter. Then the edge of the
white matter was followed to the inferior surface of the hippocampus. The outline then followed the surface of the brain back to the starting point. (This protocol was based on the fact that the most anterior and posterior edges of entorhinal cortex and the banks of the superior temporal sulcus are difficult to define with reliability. Moreover, unbiased stereological data from human brain tissue indicate that the neuron counts within a single section of these brain regions are excellent predictors of total volume.17,18)";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

(c) The region of the cingulate gyrus measured in the present study, as delineated on the MRI scan of a control subject.

Second, the cingulate gyrus was outlined; this began at the lateral most point of the corpus callosum sulcus, continued along the surface of the callosum medially to the interhemispheric fissure, then dorsally to the cingulate sulcus, and then laterally to the lateral most extent of the cingulate sulcus; to surround the portion of the cingulate gyrus to be measured, a straight line was then drawn connecting the lateral most extent of the cingulate and the corpus callosum sulci. Third, the outlined region was then divided into three sections by two lines: the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC) was identified by drawing a line in the coronal plane at the tip of the corpus callosum, and the caudal portion of the anterior cingulate (CAC) was differentiated

"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."

soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30

(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau

(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,

soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau

anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200

a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left).

and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM

soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components

(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau

anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM

soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale.

filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology. Bars, 100 nm.";"Fill in your group notes here.";"Fill in your private notes here."
"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM

soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left).

In post mortem superior frontal cortex (E), a significantly greater percentage of neurons exhibited immunoreactivity for Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl)
cross-linking using antibody 81D4 in the AD brain as compared with control brain (*P<0.05). Pooling of cases devoid of neurofibrillary pathology also results in a statistically significant difference between AD and pooled control and schizophrenic brain (**P<0.01). 
Data represent mean cell counts from six non-overlapping fields from two experiments. Neurological group means represent pooled data from AD (N=8), normal (N=3), and schizophrenic (N=7) patients. Numbers in bars indicate the total number of cells counted for statistical comparisons.

"Colocalization of cross-link and pathological tau proteins. Single- and double-label immunofluorescence for tau and cross-link antibodies is shown in images generated by scanning-laser confocal microscopy of orbital frontal cortex from AD brain. 
PHF tau immunolabeling is represented by the color green with conformation-dependent tau antibody MC1 (A) and phosphorylation-dependent tau antibody AT8 (B).
Cross-link immunofluorescence using antibody 81D4 (against the Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl)lysine cross-link is represented by the color red (A and B).
Examples of single-label tau immunolabeling are indicated by open arrowheads. Single-label cross-link immunolabeling is indicated by filled
arrowheads. Colocalization of tau and cross-link immunoreactivity is represented by the color yellow and are illustrated in examples marked with
arrows. The white calibration bars in the lower-left corner of each image indicate a distance of 20 Âµm.
