"Enlargement of the temporal horn (also called inferior horn) of the lateral ventricles 1, 2. This enlargement can either be symmetric as well as asymmetric. The higher the rates of ventricular enlargement are in healthy persons, the greater is relative hazard for AD3, 4. When examining the volume of the temporal horn, age should be taken into account, because the size of the temporal horn increases with increasing age 5. Yearly measurements of  the temporal horn in alzheimer patients have shown a 14.16 /-8.47 percentage increase per year (p = 0.002)6. Enlargement of the temporal horn is caused by atrophy in the hippocampal, amygdala and entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in the temporal lobe.";"1";"atrophy";"1";"atrophy"
"Diffuse cerebral atrophy increases with the progress of clinical stage of Alzheimer patients. Atrophy should be looked at relative to what is normal, correct for head size, age5, and some studies also correct for gender, however Mu et al5 found no differences in gender. Although global cerebral atrophy is found in Alzheimer patients 1,7, some parts of the brain are affected worse than other parts, especially the medial temporal lobe area is affected8. Atrophy can be found in the hippocampal, amygdala and entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in the temporal lobe. Atrophy in these areas results in enlargement of the temporal horn.";"6";"atrophy, atrophy, atrophy, atrophy, atrophy, normal";"2";"atrophy, normal"
"Widened sulci in alzheimer patients due to atrophy seen in several brain regions. The widening of sulci is presented in different sulci, including supracallosal, cingulate, marginal, parieto-occipital, anterior and posterior calcarine sulci, and Sylvian fissures. The widening of the sulci lead to an increased CSF volume.";"1";"atrophy";"1";"atrophy"

These signal abnormalities possibly reflect the cortical histopathology of AD. Note also moderate PVH and mild-to-moderate SCL.

First described by Alzheimer in 1907 (93) neurofibrillary tangles are paired helical and straight filaments (91). Tau proteins -the low molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins of the neuronal cytoskeleton- are building blocks of paired helical filaments.

E: Hirano bodies in the hippocampus. The right half of the section is stained with the standard H E dyes. These intraneuronal rod-shaped inclusions are easily seen on the immunostained section (left using antibody to actin and neurofilaments) as brown rod-like structures but they are less evident when stained by routine H E technique Hirano bodies are eosinophillic and more subtle. Hirano bodies primarily arise as a consequence of perturbations of the microfilament system (ie. actin tropomyosin vinculin and aplha actinin).";"0";"";"0";""
"Together with the hippocampus the amygdala is of the major sites of damage in Alzheimers disease. The amygdala is involved in emotional behaviour and also cognition during emotional changes in human. The role of the amygdala in memory function remains controversial. There is evidence that the amydala begins to atrophy earlier than hippocampus18 this is of importance for diagnosing AD in a very early stage. A reduction of 36% is found in the amygdale of AD patients when looking at the size of the amygdala in relation to total intracranial volume a reduction of 40% was found. The amount of atrophy depended on the mini-mental state 10. Some studies indicate that the accuracy of AD diagnosis increases by volumetry of amygdala-hippocampal complex (AHC) compared to only volumetric measurements of the hippocampus {Lehericy 1994 23 id";"3";"atrophy, atrophy, disease";"2";"atrophy, disease"

Schematic representation of the secretory and proliferative heterogeneity of the rat intrahepatic biliary epithelium. The cartoon shows that the major anatomical sites of secretin-stimulated choleresis are restricted to large (but not small) cholangiocytes in large bile ducts. The cartoon also shows that large ducts selectively proliferate in response to BDL following acute CCl4 administration. Apoptosis was observed only in large cholangiocytes and this was accompanied by loss of function with decreased proliferation and secretion in large cholangiocytes and loss of the choleretic effect of secretin. Concomitant with loss of large duct functions, small cholangiocytes proliferate de novo and respond to secretin to compensate for loss of function of large ducts after CCl4 administration.";"1";"apoptosis";"1";"apoptosis"

"Domain structure of tau isoforms and constructs. Tau40 is the longest tau isoform in the human CNS, occurring mostly in axons (Goedert et al., 1989). It consists of 441 amino acid residues and can be divided into an NH2-terminal projection domain and a COOH-terminal microtubule binding domain containing four imperfect repeats (R1√êR4) and basic proline-rich sequences on either side that act as microtubule targeting domains (shaded dark, P1, and P2). The repeats show high homology between tau, MAP2, and MAP4. The shaded NH2-terminal inserts and repeat two can be alternatively spliced, resulting in six different tau isoforms. The predominantly embryonic isoform tau23 lacks all three inserts (352 residues). Tau constructs K12 and K10 are derived from tau23, they contain three repeats plus either a COOHterminal flanking region (K12) or the whole COOH-terminal tail (K10). K35 contains three repeats and the basic proline-rich regions on either side, including the COOH-terminal tail. K23 contains all of tau23 except the repeats.";"0";"";"0";""
"Transferrin recycling is retarded by tau overexpression. Cells were seeded on cover slips and preincubated with TMR-labeled transferrin in serum-free medium for 2 h. Excess transferrin was removed and tau-stable and mock-transfected cells were fixed in methanol. Residual transferrin fluorescence was then quantitated and plotted (a). Note that, at early time points (7 min), the transferrin fluorescence in tau-stable cells is decreased by z10%, whereas in control cells 50% of transferrin is exocytosed in the same time interval. 300 cells were quantitated per time point and cell line. (b) Time course of the exocytosis of transferrin after equilibration of tau-stable and mock-transfected cells with fluorescently labeled transferrin.

"The expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum in differentiated neuroblastoma cells is significantly reduced by overexpression of tau. Tau-stable N2a cells (a√êc) or  ock-transfected cells (d√êf) were induced to differentiate, and then fixed in  araformaldehyde and triple-labeled with antibodies against the ER (a and d), tubulin (b and e), and tau (c and f). In contrast to control cells, z82% of tau-stable neuroblastoma cells show the ER clustered at one side of the nucleus (a), whereas in mock-transfected cells the ER surrounds the entire nucleus (d; compare Table I). Furthermore, the expansion of the ER into the neurites in control cells (d) can clearly be seen. In tau-stable cells, only a faint signal of ER-immunoreactivity is visible in neuritic processes. The total intensity of the ER stain is the same in both cells. Arrowheads in a and d are indicating the position of the neurite relative to the cell body.

"Effects of different tau constructs on mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells. Mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells stably transfected with different tau constructs was examined after paraformaldehyde fixation. This allows the visualization of total tau in the cells, but tends to dissociate tau from the microtubules (see Materials and Methods). Human tau23, the shortest tau-isoform (a and b), as well as K35 (c and d), a tau construct lacking nearly the entire projection domain (see Fig. 1) both led to the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering near the MTOC as seen in tau40-stable cells. On the other hand, K23 (e and f), a tau construct lacking the microtubule-binding region and K12 (g and h), consisting mainly of this MT-binding region (Fig. 1), did not alter the distribution of mitochondria. This argues for a tight binding of tau to microtubules as a prerequisite for impairment of plus-end√êdirected transport of these organelles and excludes the possibility that tau might inhibit kinesin by directly interacting with the motor protein. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker¬™ Red (a, c, e, and g) and transfected tau with polyclonal anti√êtau antibody K9JA (b, d, f, and h). Bar, 20 mm.";"0";"";"0";""

The entorhinal cortex is located inframedially on the surface of the brain. It is fused with the subiculum of the hippocampus medially and extends to the rhinal sulcus laterally. The entorhinal cortex was outlined on three consecutive normalized coronal images centered at the level of the mammillary bodies. The outline of the region began at the angle formed by the junction of the rhinal sulcus and the surface of the brain (the posterior end of this region may be continuous with the collateral sulcus in some subjects). The outline then transected this angle, cutting across the gray matter to the level of the white matter. Then the edge of the white matter was followed to the inferior surface of the hippocampus. The outline then followed the surface of the brain back to the starting point. (This protocol was based on the fact that the most anterior and posterior edges of entorhinal cortex and the banks of the superior temporal sulcus are difficult to define with reliability. Moreover, unbiased stereological data from human brain tissue indicate that the neuron counts within a single section of these brain regions are excellent predictors of total volume.17,18)";"0";"";"0";""

(c) The region of the cingulate gyrus measured in the present study, as delineated on the MRI scan of a control subject. The cingulate gyrus was measured on consecutive normalized coronal slices from the rostral most extent to the marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus. First, the sagittal view was used to demarcate the cingulate sulcus in each hemisphere. This information was then transferred to the coronal image. Second, the cingulate gyrus was outlined; this began at the lateral most point of the corpus callosum sulcus, continued along the surface of the callosum medially to the interhemispheric fissure, then dorsally to the cingulate sulcus, and then laterally to the lateral most extent of the cingulate sulcus; to surround the portion of the cingulate gyrus to be measured, a straight line was then drawn connecting the lateral most extent of the cingulate and the corpus callosum sulci. Third, the outlined region was then divided into three sections by two lines: the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC) was identified by drawing a line in the coronal plane at the tip of the corpus callosum, and the caudal portion of the anterior cingulate (CAC) was differentiated from the posterior cingulate (PC) by drawing a line through the cingulate gyrus in the coronal plane at the level of the mammillary bodies (white matter tracts representing the end of the fornix are used to mark the middle of the mamillary bodies in this plane).";"0";"";"0";""
