"[ Alzheimer's disease ( AD ), also called Alzheimer disease , senile dementia of the Alzheimer type , primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer's type , simply Alzheimer's (as a stand-alone attributive adjective noun ), and folk-etymological names such as "old-timers' disease", is the most common form of dementia . This incurable, degenerative , and terminal disease was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906 and was named after him. [ 1 ] Most often, it is diagnosed in people over 65&#160years of age, [ 2 ] although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. In 2006, there were 26.6 million sufferers worldwide. Alzheimer's is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people globally by 2050. [ 3 ] , Although the course of Alzheimer's disease is unique for every individual, there are many common symptoms. [ 4 ] The earliest observable symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be 'age-related' concerns, or manifestations of stress . [ 5 ] In the early stages, the most common symptom is inability to acquire new memories, observed as difficulty in recalling recently observed events. When AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with behavioural assessments and cognitive tests , often followed by a brain scan if available. [ 6 ] , As the disease advances, symptoms include confusion , irritability and aggression, mood swings , language breakdown, long-term memory loss, and the general withdrawal of the sufferer as the senses decline. [ 5 ]  [ 7 ] Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. [ 8 ] Individual prognosis is difficult to assess, as the duration of the disease varies. AD develops for an indeterminate period of time before becoming fully apparent, and it can progress undiagnosed for years. The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. [ 9 ] Fewer than three percent of individuals live more than fourteen years after diagnosis. [ 10 ] , The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood. Research indicates that the disease is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain . [ 11 ] Currently used treatments offer a small symptomatic benefit no treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are, as of yet, available. As of 2008 [update] , more than 500 clinical trials have been conducted for identification of a possible treatment for AD, but it is unknown if any of the tested intervention strategies will show promising results. [ 12 ] A number of non-invasive, life-style habits have been suggested for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease, but there is a lack of adequate evidence for a link between these recommendations and reduced degeneration. Mental stimulation , exercise , and a balanced diet are suggested, as both a possible prevention and a sensible way of managing the disease. [ 13 ] , Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, management of personal health is essential. The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. [ 14 ] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers  the pressures can be wide-ranging, involving social, psychological, physical, and economic elements of the caregiver's life. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ]  [ 17 ] In developed countries , AD is one of the most costly diseases to society. [ 18 ]  [ 19 ] , The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of cognitive and functional impairments . , The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to aging or stress . [ 5 ] Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. [ 20 ] These early symptoms can affect the most complex daily living activities . [ 21 ] The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information. [ 20 ]  [ 22 ] , Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness , planning , flexibility, and abstract thinking , or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD. [ 20 ]  Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. [ 23 ] The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed mild cognitive impairment , [ 22 ] but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute. [ 24 ] , In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception ( agnosia ), or execution of movements ( apraxia ) are more prominent than memory problems. [ 25 ] AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life ( episodic memory ), facts learned ( semantic memory ), and implicit memory (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories. [ 26 ]  [ 27 ] , Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency , which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and written language . [ 25 ]  [ 28 ] In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of adequately communicating basic ideas. [ 25 ]  [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] While performing fine motor tasks such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ( apraxia ) may be present but they are commonly unnoticed. [ 25 ] As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities. [ 25 ] , Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living. [ 25 ] Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ( paraphasias ). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. [ 25 ]  [ 29 ] Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. [ 25 ] During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. [ 25 ]  Long-term memory , which was previously intact, becomes impaired. [ 25 ] , Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering , irritability and labile affect , leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression , or resistance to caregiving. [ 25 ]  Sundowning can also appear. [ 30 ] Approximately 30% of people with AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. [ 25 ] Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ( anosognosia ). [ 25 ]  Urinary incontinence can develop. [ 25 ] These symptoms create stress for relatives and caretakers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities . [ 25 ]  [ 31 ] , During this last stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon caregivers. [ 25 ] Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. [ 25 ]  [ 29 ] Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. [ 25 ] Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common results. [ 25 ] People with AD will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks without assistance. [ 25 ]  Muscle mass and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose the ability to feed themselves. [ 25 ] AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of death typically being an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia , not the disease itself. [ 25 ] , The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still essentially unknown [ 32 ]  [ 33 ] (except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified). Several competing hypotheses exist trying to explain the cause of the disease. The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis , [ 34 ] which proposes that AD is caused by reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine . The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, [ 35 ] leading to generalised neuroinflammation. [ 36 ] , In 1991, the amyloid hypothesis postulated that amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease. [ 37 ]  [ 38 ] Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21 , together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 ( Down Syndrome ) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD by 40&#160years of age. [ 39 ]  [ 40 ] Also APOE4 , the major genetic risk factor for AD, leads to excess amyloid buildup in the brain before AD symptoms arise. Thus, Aβ deposition precedes clinical AD. [ 41 ] Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits. [ 42 ] , An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia. [ 43 ] Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. [ 44 ] One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein , the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease. [ 45 ] , In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by aging-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. [ 46 ] N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus , is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21 ). [ 46 ] DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the aging brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function. , A 2004 study found that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss. [ 47 ] This observation supports the tau hypothesis , the idea that tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. [ 38 ] In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. [ 48 ] When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, collapsing the neuron's transport system. [ 49 ] This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells. [ 50 ]  Herpes simplex virus type 1 has also been proposed to play a causative role in people carrying the susceptible versions of the apoE gene. [ 51 ] , Another hypothesis asserts that the disease may be caused by age-related myelin breakdown in the brain. Demyelination leads to axonal transport disruptions, leading to loss of neurons that become stale. Iron released during myelin breakdown is hypothesized to cause further damage. Homeostatic myelin repair processes contribute to the development of proteinaceous deposits such as amyloid-beta and tau. [ 52 ]  [ 53 ]  [ 54 ] , Oxidative stress and dys- homeostasis of biometal (biology) metabolism may be significant in the formation of the pathology. [ 55 ]  [ 56 ] , AD individuals show 70% loss of locus coeruleus cells that provide norepinephrine (in addition to its neurotransmitter role) that locally diffuses from "varicosities" as an endogenous antiinflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. [ 57 ] It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress Aβ-induced production of cytokines and their phagocytosis of Aβ. [ 57 ] This suggests that degeneration of the locus ceruleus might be responsible for increased Aβ deposition in AD brains. [ 57 ] , Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe , and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus . [ 36 ] Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults. [ 58 ] , Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in brains of those afflicted by AD. [ 11 ] Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of amyloid-beta peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of aging, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. [ 59 ]  Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD. [ 60 ] , Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease ( proteopathy ), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau proteins in the brain. [ 61 ] Plaques are made up of small peptides , 39–43&#160 amino acids in length, called beta-amyloid (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. [ 62 ]  [ 63 ] In Alzheimer's disease, an unknown process causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments by enzymes through proteolysis . [ 64 ] One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta-amyloid, which form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques . [ 11 ]  [ 65 ] , AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein . Every neuron has a cytoskeleton , an internal support structure partly made up of structures called microtubules . These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilizes the microtubules when phosphorylated , and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein . In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated  it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system. [ 66 ] , Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta amyloid peptide gives rise to the pathology of AD is not known. [ 67 ] The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils , which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis , induces programmed cell death ( apoptosis ). [ 68 ] It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons. [ 69 ] , Various inflammatory processes and cytokines may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. [ 70 ] , Alterations in the distribution of different neurotrophic factors and in the expression of their receptors such as the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been described in AD. [ 71 ]  [ 72 ] , The vast majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, meaning that they are not genetically inherited although some genes may act as risk factors. On the other hand, around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of autosomal dominant (not sex-linked) inheritance, which usually have an onset before age 65. [ 73 ] This form of the disease is known as Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease . , Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. [ 74 ] Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ 42, which is the main component of senile plaques . [ 75 ] Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—e.g., Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels. [ 75 ]  [ 76 ] This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of Aβ produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than Aβ. , Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant inheritance and are termed sporadic AD. Nevertheless genetic differences may act as risk factors . The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). [ 77 ]  [ 78 ] Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one apoE4 allele. [ 78 ] The APOEε4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. [ 73 ] However, it must be noted that this "genetic" effect is not necessarily purely genetic. For example, certain Nigerian populations have no relationship between presence or dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease. [ 79 ]  [ 80 ] Geneticists agree that numerous other genes also act as risk factors or have protective effects that influence the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease, [ 74 ] but results such as the Nigerian studies and the incomplete penetrance for all genetic risk factors associated with sporadic Alzheimers indicate a strong role for environmental effects. Over 400 genes have been tested for association with late-onset sporadic AD, [ 74 ] most with null results. [ 73 ] , Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed clinically from the patient history, collateral history from relatives, and clinical observations, based on the presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features and the absence of alternative conditions . [ 81 ]  [ 82 ] Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. [ 83 ] Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease. [ 84 ] , Assessment of intellectual functioning including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease. [ 5 ] Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practicing physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy post-mortem when brain material is available and can be examined histologically . [ 85 ] , The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, now known as the Alzheimer's Association ) established the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, [ 85 ] extensively updated in 2007. [ 86 ] These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment , and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. [ 87 ] Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD— memory , language , perceptual skills , attention , constructive abilities, orientation , problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association . [ 88 ]  [ 89 ] , Neuropsychological tests such as the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), are widely used to evaluate the cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. [ 90 ]  [ 91 ]  Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia. , Further neurological examinations are crucial in the differential diagnosis of AD and other diseases. [ 5 ] Interviews with family members are also utilised in the assessment of the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, as well as on the decrease, over time, of the person's mental function . [ 84 ] A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits . [ 92 ] Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician. [ 93 ] , Another recent objective marker of the disease is the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for amyloid beta or tau proteins, [ 94 ] both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau 181P protein concentrations. [ 95 ] Searching for these proteins using a spinal tap can predict the onset of Alzheimer's with a sensitivity of between 94% and 100%. [ 95 ] When used in conjunction with existing neuroimaging techniques, doctors can identify people with significant memory loss who are already developing the disease. [ 95 ] Spinal fluid tests are commercially available, unlike the latest neuroimaging technology. [ 96 ] Alzheimer's was diagnosed in one-third of the people who did not have any symptoms in a 2010 study, meaning that disease progression occurs well before symptoms occur. [ 97 ] , Supplemental testing provides extra information on some features of the disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD [ 5 ] —causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. [ 98 ] It is common to perform thyroid function tests , assess B12 , rule out syphillis , rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anemia. (See differential diagnosis for Dementia). (It is also necessary to rule out delirium ). , Psychological tests for depression are employed, since depression can either be concurrent with AD (see Depression of Alzheimer disease ), an early sign of cognitive impairment, [ 99 ] or even the cause. [ 100 ]  [ 101 ] , When available as a diagnostic tool, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging are used to confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer's in conjunction with evaluations involving mental status examination . [ 102 ] In a person already having dementia, SPECT appears to be superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other possible causes, compared with the usual attempts employing mental testing and medical history analysis. [ 103 ] Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria. [ 5 ]  [ 86 ] , A new technique known as PiB PET has been developed for directly and clearly imaging beta-amyloid deposits in vivo using a tracer that binds selectively to the A-beta deposits. [ 104 ] The PiB-PET compound uses carbon-11 PET scanning. Recent studies suggest that PiB-PET is 86% accurate in predicting which people with mild cognitive impairment will develop Alzheimer's disease within two years, and 92% accurate in ruling out the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. [ 105 ] , A similar PET scanning radiopharmaceutical compound called (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-([ 18 F]-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-methyl benzenamine, or 18 F AV-45, or florbetapir-fluorine-18, or simply florbetapir , contains the longer-lasting radionuclide fluorine-18 , has recently been created, and tested as a possible diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease. [ 106 ]  [ 107 ]  [ 108 ]  [ 109 ] Florbetapir, like PiB, binds to beta-amyloid, but due to its use of fluorine-18 has a half-life of 110 minutes, in contrast to PiB's radioactive half life of 20 minutes. Wong et al. found that the longer life allowed the tracer to accumulate significantly more in the brains of people with AD, particularly in the regions known to be associated with beta-amyloid deposits. [ 109 ] , One review predicted that amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative. [ 110 ] , Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study. [ 111 ] , Recent studies have shown that people with AD had decreased glutamate (Glu) as well as decreased Glu/ creatine (Cr), Glu/myo-inositol (mI), Glu/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and NAA/Cr ratios compared to normal people. Both decreased NAA/Cr and decreased hippocampal glutamate may be an early indicator of AD. [ 112 ] , Early research in mouse models may have identified markers for AD. The applicability of these markers is unknown. [ 113 ] , A small human study in 2011 found that monitoring blood dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) variations in response to an oxidative stress could be a useful proxy test: the subjects with MCI did not have a DHEA variation, while the healthy controls did. [ 114 ] , At present, there is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. [ 115 ] Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results. However, epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors can help to prevent AD. [ 116 ] , Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , diabetes , and smoking, are associated with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, [ 117 ]  [ 118 ]  statins , which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease. [ 119 ]  [ 120 ] The components of a Mediterranean diet , which include fruit and vegetables, bread , wheat and other cereals , olive oil , fish , and red wine , may all individually or together reduce the risk and course of Alzheimer's disease. [ 121 ] Its beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action. [ 121 ] There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. [ 122 ] , Reviews on the use of vitamins have not found enough evidence of efficacy to recommend vitamin C, [ 123 ] E, [ 123 ]  [ 124 ] or folic acid with or without vitamin B 12 , [ 125 ] as preventive or treatment agents in AD. Additionally vitamin E is associated with important health risks. [ 123 ] Trials examining folic acid (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline. [ 126 ]  Docosahexaenoic acid , an Omega 3 fatty acid, has not been found to slow decline. [ 127 ] , Long-term usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing AD. [ 128 ] Human postmortem studies, in animal models , or in vitro investigations also support the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. [ 128 ] However trials investigating their use as palliative treatment have failed to show positive results while no prevention trial has been completed. [ 128 ]  Curcumin from the curry spice turmeric has shown some effectiveness in preventing brain damage in mouse models due to its anti-inflammatory properties. [ 129 ]  [ 130 ]  Hormone replacement therapy , although previously used, is no longer thought to prevent dementia and in some cases may even be related to it. [ 131 ]  [ 132 ] There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia, [ 133 ] and a recent study concludes that it has no effect in reducing the rate of AD incidence. [ 134 ] A 21-year study found that coffee drinkers of 3–5 cups per day at midlife had a 65% reduction in risk of dementia in late-life. [ 135 ] , People who engage in intellectual activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments , or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. [ 136 ] This is compatible with the cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. [ 136 ] Education delays the onset of AD syndrome, but is not related to earlier death after diagnosis. [ 137 ] Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease. [ 138 ]  Physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of AD. [ 137 ] , Medical marijuana appears to be effective in delaying Alzheimer's Disease. The active ingredient in marijuana, THC , prevents the formation of deposits in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease. THC was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase more effectively than commercially marketed drugs. THC was also found to delay amylogenesis. [ 139 ]  [ 140 ] , Some studies have shown an increased risk of developing AD with environmental factors such the intake of metals , particularly aluminium , [ 141 ]  [ 142 ] or exposure to solvents . [ 143 ] The quality of some of these studies has been criticised, [ 144 ] and other studies have concluded that there is no relationship between these environmental factors and the development of AD. [ 145 ]  [ 146 ]  [ 147 ]  [ 148 ] , While some studies suggest that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease, reviewers found that further epidemiological and laboratory investigations of this hypothesis are needed. [ 149 ] Smoking is a significant AD risk factor. [ 150 ]  Systemic markers of the innate immune system are risk factors for late-onset AD. [ 151 ] , There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving. , Four medications are currently approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat the cognitive manifestations of AD: three are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the other is memantine , an NMDA receptor antagonist . No drug has an indication for delaying or halting the progression of the disease. , Reduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. [ 152 ]  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. [ 153 ] As of 2008 [update] , the cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the management of AD symptoms are donepezil (brand name Aricept ), [ 154 ]  galantamine ( Razadyne ), [ 155 ] and rivastigmine (branded as Exelon [ 156 ] and Exelon Patch [ 157 ] ). There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, [ 158 ]  [ 159 ] and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. [ 160 ] The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. [ 161 ] The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting , both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users and are mild to moderate in severity. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps , decreased heart rate ( bradycardia ), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production. [ 162 ] , Glutamate is a useful excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system , although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors . Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis . [ 163 ]  Memantine (brand names Akatinol , Axura , Ebixa / Abixa , Memox and Namenda ), [ 164 ] is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti- influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. [ 163 ] Memantine has been shown to be moderately efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Its effects in the initial stages of AD are unknown. [ 165 ] Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations , confusion , dizziness , headache and fatigue . [ 166 ] The combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness". [ 167 ] , Antipsychotic drugs are modestly useful in reducing aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease with behavioural problems, but are associated with serious adverse effects, such as cerebrovascular events, movement difficulties or cognitive decline, that do not permit their routine use. [ 168 ]  [ 169 ] When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality. [ 169 ] , People with Alzheimer’s disease who have taken Huperzine A may have improved general cognitive function, global clinical status, functional performance and reduced behavioural disturbance compared to people taking placebos, according to a Cochrane Review, however, the poor methodological quality of the small trials, including problems with blinding and randomization, led reviewers to conclude "There is currently insufficient evidence of the effects of Huperzine A for Alzheimer's disease (AD)." [ 170 ] , Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general. [ 171 ] , Behavioural interventions attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, [ 172 ] but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence . [ 173 ] There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering. [ 174 ]  [ 175 ] , Emotion-oriented interventions include reminiscence therapy , validation therapy , supportive psychotherapy , sensory integration , also called snoezelen , and simulated presence therapy . Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. [ 171 ] Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood . [ 176 ] Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours . [ 177 ] Finally, validation therapy is based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration is based on exercises aimed to stimulate senses . There is little evidence to support the usefulness of these therapies. [ 178 ]  [ 179 ] , The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining , is the reduction of cognitive deficits . Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, [ 180 ]  [ 181 ] although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported. [ 171 ] , Stimulation-oriented treatments include art , music and pet therapies, exercise , and any other kind of recreational activities . Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine. [ 171 ] , Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease. , During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. [ 182 ]  [ 183 ] Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects. [ 171 ]  [ 184 ]  [ 185 ] The patient may also become incapable of feeding themselves, so they require food in smaller pieces or pureed. [ 186 ] When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. [ 187 ]  [ 188 ] The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers. [ 171 ] , As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease , pressure ulcers , malnutrition , hygiene problems, or respiratory , skin , or eye infections . Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise. [ 189 ]  [ 190 ] During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death. [ 191 ] , A small recent study in the US concluded that people whose caregivers had a realistic understanding of the prognosis and clinical complications of late dementia were less likely to receive aggressive treatment near the end of life. [ 192 ] , There is strong evidence that feeding tubes do not help people with advanced Alzheimer's dementia gain weight, regain strength or function, prevent aspiration pneumonias, or improve quality of life. [ 193 ]  [ 194 ]  [ 195 ]  [ 196 ] , The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living. [ 25 ] , Life expectancy of the population with the disease is reduced. [ 9 ]  [ 197 ]  [ 198 ] The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. [ 9 ] Fewer than 3% of people live more than fourteen years. [ 10 ] Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems , diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival. [ 197 ]  [ 199 ]  [ 200 ] While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger. [ 198 ] Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women. [ 10 ]  [ 201 ] , The disease is the underlying cause of death in 70% of all cases. [ 9 ]  Pneumonia and dehydration are the most frequent immediate causes of death, while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population. [ 9 ]  [ 201 ] , Two main measures are used in epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years) while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time. , Regarding incidence, cohort longitudinal studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, [ 202 ]  [ 203 ] which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. [ 202 ]  [ 203 ] There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. [ 203 ]  [ 204 ] , Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group. [ 205 ] Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower. [ 206 ] The World Health Organization estimated that in 2005, 0.379% of people worldwide had dementia, and that the prevalence would increase to 0.441% in 2015 and to 0.556% in 2030. [ 207 ] Other studies have reached similar conclusions. [ 206 ] Another study estimated that in 2006, 0.40% of the world population (range 0.17–0.89% absolute number 26.6 million , range 11.4–59.4 million ) were afflicted by AD, and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050. [ 3 ] , The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia . [ 1 ] It was not until 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D . Alzheimer followed her until she died in 1906, when he first reported the case publicly. [ 208 ] During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature , some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. [ 1 ] The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. [ 209 ] He included Alzheimer's disease , also named presenile dementia by Kraepelin, as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry , published on July 15, 1910. [ 210 ] , For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes. [ 211 ] This eventually led to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease independently of age. [ 212 ] The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used for those younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology . [ 213 ] , Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, [ 18 ]  [ 19 ] while their cost in other countries such as Argentina , [ 214 ] or South Korea , [ 215 ] is also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem . AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care , direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care , and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. [ 19 ] Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160&#160billion, [ 216 ] while costs of Alzheimer in the United States may be $100&#160billion each year. [ 19 ] , The greatest origin of costs for society is the long-term care by health care professionals and particularly institutionalisation , which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. [ 18 ]  The cost of living at home is also very high, [ 18 ] especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account. [ 217 ] , Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural disturbances, [ 218 ] and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. [ 217 ] Therefore any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results. [ 19 ] , The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. [ 14 ] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ]  [ 17 ] Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. [ 219 ] This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care. [ 219 ]  [ 220 ] Nevertheless two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias. [ 171 ] , Dementia caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and mental disorders. [ 221 ] Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation . [ 222 ]  [ 223 ] Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47&#160hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study. [ 14 ]  [ 217 ] , Cognitive behavioural therapy and the teaching of coping strategies either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers' psychological health. [ 15 ]  [ 224 ] , As Alzheimer's disease is highly prevalent, many notable people have developed it. Well-known examples are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch , both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities deteriorated with the disease. [ 225 ]  [ 226 ]  [ 227 ] Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskas , [ 228 ] the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Suárez ( Spain ), [ 229 ]  [ 230 ] the actress Rita Hayworth , [ 231 ] the actor Charlton Heston , [ 232 ] the novelist Terry Pratchett , [ 233 ] Indian politician George Fernandes , [ 234 ] and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao . [ 235 ] , AD has also been portrayed in films such as: Iris (2001), [ 236 ] based on John Bayley 's memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch  [ 237 ]  The Notebook (2004), [ 238 ] based on Nicholas Sparks ' 1996 novel of the same name  [ 239 ]  A Moment to Remember (2004) Thanmathra (2005) [ 240 ]  Memories of Tomorrow (Ashita no Kioku) (2006), [ 241 ] based on Hiroshi Ogiwara's novel of the same name [ 242 ]  Away from Her (2006), based on Alice Munro 's short story " The Bear Came over the Mountain ". [ 243 ] Documentaries on Alzheimer's disease include Malcolm and Barbara: A Love Story (1999) and Malcolm and Barbara: Love's Farewell (2007), both featuring Malcolm Pointon . [ 244 ] , As of 2010 [update] , the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments had been or were being investigated in 858 clinical trials worldwide, and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in Phase&#160III trials the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies. [ 245 ] , One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of amyloid beta levels is a common target of compounds [ 246 ] (such as apomorphine ) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. [ 247 ] Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. [ 248 ] An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, [ 249 ]  [ 250 ] although the trials were suspended in 2008. [ 251 ] Another similar agent is bapineuzumab , an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. [ 252 ] Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, [ 253 ] and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. [ 254 ] A TNFα receptor fusion protein , etanercept has showed encouraging results. [ 255 ] , In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with methylthioninium chloride (trade name rember ), a drug that inhibits tau aggregation, [ 256 ]  [ 257 ] and dimebon , an antihistamine . [ 258 ] The consecutive Phase-III trial of Dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints. [ 259 ] , The possibility that AD could be treated with antiviral medication is suggested by a study showing colocation of herpes simplex virus with amyloid plaques. [ 260 ] , Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging. Limitations of this research can be addressed in future studies with more detailed analyses. [ 261 ] , An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of florbetapir (tradename: Amyvid), which is currently used in an investigational study. The agent can detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially.

"[ Apoptosis ( &#160 /  ˌ  æ  p  ə  ˈ  t  oʊ  s  ɪ  s  / ) [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms . [ 3 ]  Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes ( morphology ) and death. These changes include blebbing , cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation , and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. (See also Apoptosis DNA fragmentation .) Unlike necrosis , apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage. [ 4 ] , In contrast to necrosis , which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis, in general, confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose the result is that the digits are separate. Between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 billion to 30 billion cells die a day. [ 5 ] , Research in and around apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes atrophy , whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer . , German scientist Carl Vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis ( Greek : apo - from/off/without, ptosis - falling) from traumatic cell death. [ 6 ] Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R Currie, as well as Andrew Wyllie , who was Currie's graduate student, [ 7 ] at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the British Journal of Cancer . [ 8 ] Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis . Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at University of Aberdeen , with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist Robert Horvitz . [ 9 ] The 2002 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner , Horvitz and John E. Sulston for their work regarding apoptosis. , In Greek, apoptosis translates to the "dropping off" of petals or leaves from plants or trees. Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. Hippocrates used the term to mean "the falling off of the bones". Galen extended its meaning to "the dropping of the scabs". Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second p silent ( /  æ  p  ə  ˈ  t  oʊ  s  ɨ  s  /  ap-ə- toh -sis  [ 1 ]  [ 10 ] ) and the second p pronounced ( /  æ  p  ə  p  ˈ  t  oʊ  s  ɨ  s  / ), [ 1 ]  [ 11 ] as in the original Greek. [ citation needed ] In English, the p of the Greek -pt- consonant cluster is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. pterodactyl , Ptolemy ), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in helicopter or the orders of insects: diptera , lepidoptera , etc. , In the original Kerr Wyllie and Currie paper, British Journal of Cancer, 1972 Aug26(4):239-57, there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation: , "We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term. The word "apoptosis" ( ἁπόπτωσισ ) is used in Greek to describe the "dropping off" or "falling off" of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees. To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like "ptosis" (with the "p" silent), which comes from the same root "to fall", and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid." , The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of cell signals , which may originate either extracellularly ( extrinsic inducers ) or intracellularly ( intrinsic inducers ). Extracellular signals may include toxins , [ 12 ]  hormones , growth factors , nitric oxide [ 13 ] or cytokines , that must either cross the plasma membrane or transduce to effect a response. These signals may positively (i.e., trigger) or negatively (i.e., repress, inhibit, or dampen) affect apoptosis. (Binding and subsequent trigger of apoptosis by a molecule is termed positive induction , whereas the active repression or inhibition of apoptosis by a molecule is termed negative inductio n.) , A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell suicide. The binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids , [ 14 ] heat, [ 14 ] radiation, [ 14 ] nutrient deprivation, [ 14 ] viral infection, [ 14 ]  hypoxia [ 14 ] and increased intracellular calcium concentration, [ 15 ] for example, by damage to the membrane, can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell. A number of cellular components, such as poly ADP ribose polymerase , may also help regulate apoptosis. [ 16 ] , Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows apoptotic signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: targeting mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms. Another extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain . , The mitochondria are essential to multicellular life.&#160 Without them, a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies, a fact exploited by some apoptotic pathways.&#160 Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways.&#160 They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out. [ 14 ] &#160 There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable. [ 13 ] , Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (small mitochondria-derived activator of caspases ) are released into the cytosol following an increase in permeability.&#160 SMAC binds to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and deactivates them, preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed.&#160 IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases , [ 17 ] which carry out the degradation of the cell, therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability. , Cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane, [ 18 ] and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis. [ 14 ] &#160 Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor - 1 ( Apaf-1 ) and ATP , which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome .&#160 The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9 , which in turn activates the effector caspase-3 . , MAC , also called "Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore" is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ced-9 gene found in C. elegans . [ 19 ]  [ 20 ] &#160 Bcl-2 proteins are able to promote or inhibit apoptosis by direct action on MAC/MOMPP.&#160 Bax and/or Bak form the pore, while Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 inhibit its formation. , Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the TNF-induced ( tumour necrosis factor ) model and the Fas-Fas ligand -mediated model, both involving receptors of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family [ 21 ] coupled to extrinsic signals. , TNF is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages , and is the major extrinsic mediator of binary hipaloptic apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 . The binding of TNF to TNF-R1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain protein ( FADD ). [ 22 ] Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses. [ 23 ] The link between TNF and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in autoimmune diseases . , The Fas receptor (also known as Apo-1 or CD95 ) binds the Fas ligand (FasL), a transmembrane protein part of the TNF family. [ 21 ] The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the Fas -DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8. [ 24 ] , Following TNF-R1 and Fas activation in mammalian cells a balance between pro-apoptotic ( BAX , [ 25 ]  BID , BAK , or BAD ) and anti-apoptotic ( Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2 ) members of the Bcl-2 family is established. This balance is the proportion of pro-apoptotic homodimers that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The pro-apoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of pro-apoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of non-apoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the Bcl-2 family. , Caspase play the central role in the transduction of DR apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 8,10,9,2, and effector caspases, caspase 3,7,6. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric adaptor protein. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program. , There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF ( apoptosis-inducing factor ). [ 26 ] , Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but there is only one mechanism that actually causes the death of a cell. [ citation needed ] After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases . A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology: , Apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize. During karyorrhexis, endonuclease activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic "laddered" appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis . Tests for DNA laddering differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death. [ 30 ] , The removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed efferocytosis . [ 31 ] Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules, such as phosphatidylserine , on their cell surface. [ 32 ] Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a hypothetical protein known as scramblase . [ 33 ] These molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells possessing the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages. [ 34 ] Upon recognition, the phagocyte reorganizes its cytoskeleton for engulfment of the cell. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response . , Many knock-outs have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins.&#160 Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype.&#160 In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704-5364 was removed from the gene.&#160 This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing.&#160 TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities.&#160 However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels.&#160 Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis.&#160 Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse.&#160 This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion.&#160 When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain.&#160 Additionally, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes.&#160 Interestingly, APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation.&#160 A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons. , The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results.&#160 A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation.&#160 A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality.&#160 However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure.&#160 Interestingly, these mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli.&#160 Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation.&#160 A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO others organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown pro-apoptotic pathways exist. , The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood. [ 35 ] As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, it is a victim of causality removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its "use-by-date" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell becoming cancerous or diseased. , A recently-described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. [ 36 ] The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( XIAP ) is overexpressed in cells of the H460 cell line . XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c , therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of pro-apoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. , The tumor-suppressor protein p53 accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha- interferon and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the p53 gene and result in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis. [ 37 ] p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the cell cycle at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the p53 or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors. , Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is oftentimes characterized by an overexpression of IAP family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: cycle regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors. , The main method of treatment for death signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used to stimulate apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway. , On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage. The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis. In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells. In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated. , Treatments aiming to inhibit apoptosis work to simultaneously inhibit the expression of pro-apoptotic factors and promote the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. Fas-induced apoptosis can be blocked by use of FLIPs (FLICE-inhibitory proteins, which inhibit caspases-8 and -10), Bcl-2 (which prevents cytochrome c release and the subsequent activation of caspase 9), and CrmA (Cytokine response modifier A). Increasing the concentration of IAPs works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. , The progression of the human immunodeficiency virus infection into AIDS is primarily due to the depletion of CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways: [ 38 ] , Cells may also die as a direct consequence of viral infection. HIV-1 expression induces tubular cell G2/M arrest and apoptosis. [ 39 ] The progression from HIV to AIDS is not immediate or even necessarily rapid HIV's cytotoxic activity towards CD4+ lymphocytes is classified as AIDS once a given patient's CD4+ cell count falls below 200. [ 40 ] , Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including: , Most viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis. [ 42 ] Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 protein and the adenovirus E1B 19K protein. [ 43 ] Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response. [ 44 ] Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. Consequently p53 cannot induce apoptosis since it cannot induce the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the hepatitis B virus HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function. [ 45 ] , Interestingly, viruses can remain intact from apoptosis particularly in the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the apoptotic bodies that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus. [ 44 ] , Programmed cell death in plants has a number of molecular similarities to animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, notably the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system which removes the pieces of the dead cell. Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a vacuole which ruptures as the cell dies. Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name apoptosis (as opposed to the more general programmed cell death ) is unclear. [ 46 ] , There is an extrinsic pathway that has been noticed in several toxicity studies. It was shown that an increase in calcium concentration within a cell, caused by drug activity, also has the ability to cause apoptosis via a calcium-binding calpain protease . , In 2003, a method was developed for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins [ 47 ] Subsequently, various different modes of Chou's pseudo amino acid composition were developed for improving the quality of predicting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.

"[ Tau proteins are proteins that stabilize microtubules . They are abundant in neurons of the central nervous system and are less common elsewhere, but are also expressed at very low levels in CNS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [ 1 ] . When tau proteins are defective, and no longer stabilize microtubules properly, they can result in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease . , The tau proteins are the product of alternative splicing from a single gene that in humans is designated MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau). [ 2 ]  [ 3 ] They were discovered in 1975 in Marc Kirschner 's laboratory at Princeton University . [ 4 ] , Tau protein is a highly soluble microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In humans, these proteins are mostly found in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells. One of tau's main functions is to modulate the stability of axonal microtubules. Other nervous system MAPs may perform similar functions, as suggested by tau knockout mice, who did not show abnormalities in brain development - possibly because of compensation in tau deficiency by other MAPs [ 5 ] . Tau is not present in dendrites and is active primarily in the distal portions of axons where it provides microtubule stabilization but also flexibility as needed. This contrasts with MAP6 (STOP) proteins in the proximal portions of axons which essentially lock down the microtubules and MAP2 that stabilizes microtubules in dendrites. , Tau proteins interact with tubulin to stabilize microtubules and promote tubulin assembly into microtubules. Tau has two ways of controlling microtubule stability: isoforms and phosphorylation . , Six tau isoforms exist in human brain tissue, and they are distinguished by their number of binding domains . Three isoforms have three binding domains and the other three have four binding domains. The binding domains are located in the carboxy-terminus of the protein and are positively-charged (allowing it to bind to the negatively-charged microtubule). The isoforms with four binding domains are better at stabilizing microtubules than those with three binding domains. The isoforms are a result of alternative splicing in exons 2, 3, and 10 of the tau gene. , Tau is a phosphoprotein with 79 potential Serine (Ser) and Threonine (Thr) phosphorylation sites on the longest tau isoform. Phosphorylation has been reported on approximately 30 of these sites in normal tau proteins. [ 6 ] , Phosphorylation of tau is regulated by a host of kinases , including PKN, a serine/threonine kinase . When PKN is activated, it phosphorylates tau, resulting in disruption of microtubule organization. [ 7 ] , Phosphorylation of tau is also developmentally regulated. For example, fetal tau is more highly phosphorylated in the embryonic CNS than adult tau. [ 8 ] The degree of phosphorylation in all six isoforms decreases with age due to the activation of phosphatases. [ 9 ] Like kinases, phosphatases too play a role in regulating the phosphorylation of tau. For example, PP2A and PP2B are both present in human brain tissue and have the ability to dephosphorylate Ser396. [ 10 ] The binding of these phosphatases to tau affects tau's association with MTs. , The MAPT gene for encoding tau protein is located on chromosome 17q 21, containing 16 exons . The major tau protein in the human brain is encoded by 11 exons. Exons 2, 3 and 10 are alternatively spliced , allowing six combinations (2 – 3 – 10 –  2 + 3 – 10 –  2 + 3 + 10 –  2 – 3 – 10 +  2 + 3 – 10 +  2 + 3 + 10 + ). Thus, in the human brain, the tau proteins constitute a family of six isoforms with the range from 352-441 amino acids. They differ in either zero, one or two inserts of 29 amino acids at the N-terminal part (exon 2 and 3), and three or four repeat-regions at the C-terminal part exon 10 missing. So, the longest isoform in the CNS has four repeats (R1, R2, R3 and R4) and two inserts (441 amino acids total), while the shortest isoform has three repeats (R1, R3 and R4) and no insert (352 amino acids total). , The MAPT gene has two haplogroups , H1 and H2, in which the gene appears in inverted orientations. Haplogroup H2 is common only in Europe and in people with European ancestry. Haplogroup H1 appears to be associated with increased probability of certain dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease. The presence of both haplogroups in Europe means that recombination between inverted haplotypes can result in the lack of one of the functioning copy of the gene, resulting in congenital defects. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] , Hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein (tau inclusions, pTau) can result in the self-assembly of tangles of paired helical filaments and straight filaments, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies . [ 15 ] , All of the six tau isoforms are present in an often hyperphosphorylated state in paired helical filaments from Alzheimer's disease brain. In other neurodegenerative diseases , the deposition of aggregates enriched in certain tau isoforms has been reported. When misfolded , this otherwise very soluble protein can form extremely insoluble aggregates that contribute to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. , Tau protein has been shown to interact with FYN , [ 16 ]  Alpha-synuclein , [ 17 ]  [ 18 ]  YWHAZ [ 19 ] and S100B .

"[ The zebrafish , Danio rerio , is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the minnow family ( Cyprinidae ) of order Cypriniformes . [ 1 ] It is a popular aquarium fish , frequently sold under the trade name zebra danio , and is an important vertebrate model organism in scientific research. , The zebrafish are Cyprinidae with a derived member of the genus Danio . It has a sister group relationship with Danio kyathit . [ 2 ] , Zebrafish are closely related to the genus Devario , as demonstrated by a phylogenetic tree of close species. "Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships among danios " . http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n3/fig_tab/6800867f2.html#figure-title . &#160 , The zebrafish is native to the streams of the southeastern Himalayan region, [ 2 ] including the countries India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Nepal , and Myanmar . [ 3 ] It arose in the Ganges region in Eastern India . It commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds, and slow-moving to stagnant water bodies , including rice fields . [ 4 ] , Zebrafish have been introduced to parts of the United States , presumably by deliberate release or by escape from fish farms. [ 3 ] They have also been sighted in Colombia . , The fish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal blue stripes on the side of the body, all of which extend to the end of the caudal fin . Its shape is fusiform and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. Males are torpedo -shaped and have gold stripes between the blue stripes females have a larger, whitish belly and have silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females will exhibit a small genital papilla in front of the anal fin origin. The zebrafish can grow to 6.4 centimetres (2.5&#160in), although it is uncommon for them to grow past 4&#160cm in captivity. Life-span in captivity is around 2–3 years, although in ideal conditions, may extend to 5 years. [ 4 ] , The approximate generation time for the Danio is 3–4 months. A male must be present for ovulation and spawning to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of 2–3 days, laying hundreds of eggs in each clutch . Upon release, embryonic development begins absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes D. rerio a convenient research model species . [ 4 ] Development progresses rapidly. Precursors to all major organs appear within 36 hours of fertilization . Hatching takes place 48–72 hours after fertilization, depending on the embryo's internal conditions and the external temperature, ideally 28.5 °C (83.3&#160°F) . Swimming and feeding behavior begin about 36 hours later. The sex of juveniles cannot be distinguished except by dissection, and sex determinants are not clearly understood. , The zebrafish is omnivorous . It primarily eats zooplankton , insects and insect larvae , and phytoplankton . It can eat a variety of other foods, such as worms and small crustaceans if its preferred sources are not readily available. [ 4 ] Most Danios accept common food flakes and tubifex worms in the aquarium . , Recently, transgenic zebrafish have become commercially available that express green fluorescent protein , red fluorescent protein, and yellow fluorescent protein . They are tradenamed GloFish . Other cultivated varieties include golden , sandy , longfin and leopard . , The leopard danio, previously known as Danio frankei , is a spotted colour morph of the zebrafish caused by a pigment mutation. [ 5 ]  Xanthistic forms of both the zebra and leopard pattern, along with long-finned subspecies, have been obtained via selective breeding programs for the aquarium trade. [ 6 ] , The Zebra Fish Information Network [ 7 ] provides up-to-date information about current known wild-type (WT) strains of D. rerio . The most commonly found WT strains are: AB, TÜ, IN and WIK. , AB (AB)

Danio pigment pattern diversity and phenotypes of D. rerio hybrids with other danios. , Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists . Their ease of keeping and breeding, beauty, price, playful nature and broad availability all contribute to their popularity. They thrive best in 22–28 °C (72–82&#160°F) water. They need an aquarium of 10 US gallons (38&#160L) or more, and they do well in schools. They also thrive as shoals of six or more, and interact well with other fish types in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to Oodinium or velvet disease, microsporidia ( Pseudoloma neurophilia ), and Mycobacterium species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank. , D. rerio is a common and useful model organism for studies of vertebrate development and gene function. [ 2 ]  George Streisinger at the University of Oregon established its utility. Success with it in large scale forward genetic screens (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens) consolidated its importance. The scholarly journal Development [ 9 ] devoted an issue [ 10 ] to research using it in celebration of this landmark. It has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN). D. rerio is one of the few fish species to have reached space . They may supplement higher vertebrate models, such as rats and mice. , Research with D. rerio has allowed advances in the fields of developmental biology , oncology , [ 12 ]  toxicology , [ 13 ] reproductive studies, teratology , genetics , neurobiology , environmental sciences , stem cell and regenerative medicine , [ 14 ] and evolutionary theory . [ 8 ] , Its greatest advantages for use as a model system include: , Other advantages: , Zebrafish have the ability to regenerate fins, skin, the heart [ 17 ] and the brain (in larval stages). Heart muscle regeneration does not make use of stem cells  instead, mature heart muscle cells regress to a stem-cell-like state and redifferentiate. [ 17 ] In 2011 the British Heart Foundation ran an advertising (including on television and online) campaign publicising their intention to study the applicability of this ability to humans by "spend[ing] £50 million on a programme of groundbreaking research that could help us begin to repair damaged [human] hearts." [ 18 ] , Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate photoreceptor cells and retinal neurons following injury. The mechanisms of this regeneration are unknown. Researchers frequently amputate the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations. This research is leading the scientific community in the understanding of healing/repair mechanisms in vertebrates. It has also been found if the same fin is damaged enough times, the fish will grow a new fin which will have mutated only a small amount. Most scientists believe this is a defence mechanism to try to prevent the fin from being damaged again. [ citation needed ] , A common reverse genetics technique is to reduce gene expression or modify splicing using Morpholino antisense technology. Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) are stable, synthetic macromolecules that contain the same bases as DNA or RNA by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they reduce the expression of specific genes. The journal Genesis [ 19 ] devoted an issue [ 20 ] to research using MO, mostly in D. rerio . MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules, [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] allowing diffusion between cells. A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a duplication after the divergence of ray-finned fishes and lobe-finned fishes , it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene paralogs reliably due to complementation by the other paralog. , Despite the complications of the zebrafish genome , a number of commercially available global platforms for analysis of both gene expression by microarrays and promoter regulation using ChIP-on-chip exist. , In 2009, researchers at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology , Delhi announced the sequencing of a wild caught strain, containing 1.7 billion genetic letters. [ 23 ]  [ 24 ] , In October 2001, researchers from the University of Oklahoma published D. rerio's complete mitochondrial DNA sequence. [ 25 ] Its length is 16,596 base pairs. This is within 100 base pairs of other related species of fish, and it is notably only 18 pairs longer than the goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) and 21 longer than the carp ( Cyprinus carpio ). Its gene order and content is identical to the common vertebrate form of mitochondrial DNA. It contains 13 protein -coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the origin of replication for the heavy strand. In between a grouping of five tRNA genes, a sequence resembling vertebrate origin of light strand replication is found. It is difficult to draw evolutionary conclusions because it is difficult to determine whether base pair changes have adaptive significance via comparisons with other vertebrates nucleotide sequences. , In December 2005, a study of the golden strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as SLC24A5 , a solute carrier that appeared to be required for melanin production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The orthologous gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans. [ 26 ] , Transgenesis is a popular approach to study the function of genes in zebrafish. Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system. [ 27 ] , In January 2007, Chinese researchers at Fudan University genetically modified fish to detect oestrogen pollution in lakes and rivers, which is linked to male infertility. [ 28 ] , In cardiovascular research the zebrafish is being used to model blood clotting , blood vessel development , heart failure , and congenital heart disease . In programmes of research into acute inflammation , a major underpinning process in many diseases, researchers have established a zebrafish model of inflammation, and its resolution. An approach that allows detailed study of the genetic controls of inflammation and the possibility of identifying potential new drugs. , Another focus of work is to understand how a gene called Hedgehog , a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth. This is fast becoming an avenue of research that is leading to new cancer therapies. In probing disorders of the nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and deafness, researchers are using the zebrafish to understand how the genetic defects underlying these conditions cause functional abnormalities in the human brain, spinal cord and sensory organs. Researchers are delving into the complexities of muscle degeneration in genetic models of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. , These studies exemplify how zebrafish research offers unique opportunities to understanding some of the greatest challenges in medical science, by enabling new discoveries of how cells and tissues work to be translated into new ways of understanding a broad range of human diseases. , Finally, and as demonstrated through ongoing research programmes, the zebrafish models affords an ideal opportunity, not only to identify novel candidates for genes underlying human disease, but offers a potential system in which to begin to develop novel therapeutic agents in drug discovery programmes, hence helping to identify new treatments. [ 29 ] , In 2007, researchers at University College London grew a type of zebrafish adult stem cell found in the eyes of fish and mammals that develops into neurons in the retina —the part of the eye that sends messages to the brain. These cells could be injected in the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons—nearly every disease of the eye, including macular degeneration , glaucoma , and diabetes -related blindness . Retinal damage is responsible for most cases of sight loss. The researchers studied Müller glial cells in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats' retinas and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team is working on the same approach in humans. [ 30 ] , In 2008, researchers at Children's Hospital Boston developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies were transparent. [ 31 ] This allows for detailed visualization of cellular activity, circulation, metastasis and many other phenomena. Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, Casper is expected to yield insight into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers.
