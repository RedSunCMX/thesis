"[ Alzheim ' s diseas ( AD ), also call Alzheim diseas , senil dementia of the Alzheim type , primari degen dementia of the Alzheim ' s type , simpli Alzheim ' s ( as a stand - alon attribut adject noun ), and folk - etymolog name such as " old - timer ' diseas ", is the most common form of dementia . Thi incur , degen , and termin diseas wa first describ by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Aloi Alzheim in 1906 and wa name after him . [ 1 ] Most often , it is diagnos in peopl over 65 &# 160year of age , [ 2 ] although the less - preval earli - onset Alzheim ' s can occur much earlier . In 2006 , there were 26 . 6 million suffer worldwid . Alzheim ' s is predict to affect 1 in 85 peopl global by 2050 . [ 3 ] , Although the cours of Alzheim ' s diseas is uniqu for everi individu , there are mani common symptom . [ 4 ] The earliest observ symptom are often mistakenli thought to be ' age - relat ' concern , or manifest of stress . [ 5 ] In the earli stage , the most common symptom is inabl to acquir new memori , observ as difficulti in recal recent observ event . When AD is suspect , the diagnosi is usual confirm with behaviour assess and cognit test , often follow by a brain scan if avail . [ 6 ] , As the diseas advanc , symptom includ confus , irrit and aggress , mood swing , languag breakdown , long - term memori loss , and the gener withdraw of the suffer as the sens declin . [ 5 ] [ 7 ] Gradual , bodili function are lost , ultim lead to death . [ 8 ] Individu prognosi is difficult to assess , as the durat of the diseas vari . AD develop for an indetermin period of time befor becom fulli appar , and it can progress undiagnos for year . The mean life expect follow diagnosi is approxim seven year . [ 9 ] Fewer than three percent of individu live more than fourteen year after diagnosi . [ 10 ] , The caus and progress of Alzheim ' s diseas are not well understood . Research indic that the diseas is associ with plaqu and tangl in the brain . [ 11 ] Current use treatment offer a small symptomat benefit no treatment to delay or halt the progress of the diseas are , as of yet , avail . As of 2008 [ updat ] , more than 500 clinic trial have been conduct for identif of a possibl treatment for AD , but it is unknown if ani of the test intervent strategi will show promis result . [ 12 ] A number of non - invas , life - style habit have been suggest for the prevent of Alzheim ' s diseas , but there is a lack of adequ evid for a link between these recommend and reduc degener . Mental stimul , exercis , and a balanc diet are suggest , as both a possibl prevent and a sensibl way of manag the diseas . [ 13 ] , Becaus AD cannot be cure and is degen , manag of person health is essenti . The role of the main caregiv is often taken by the spous or a close rel . [ 14 ] Alzheim ' s diseas is known for place a great burden on caregiv the pressur can be wide - rang , involv social , psycholog , physic , and econom element of the caregiv ' s life . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In develop countri , AD is one of the most costli diseas to societi . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] , The diseas cours is divid into four stage , with progress pattern of cognit and function impair . , The first symptom are often mistakenli attribut to age or stress . [ 5 ] Detail neuropsycholog test can reveal mild cognit difficulti up to eight year befor a person fulfil the clinic criteria for diagnosi of AD . [ 20 ] These earli symptom can affect the most complex daili live activ . [ 21 ] The most notic deficit is memori loss , which show up as difficulti in rememb recent learn fact and inabl to acquir new inform . [ 20 ] [ 22 ] , Subtl problem with the execut function of attent , plan , flexibl , and abstract think , or impair in semant memori ( memori of mean , and concept relationship ) can also be symptomat of the earli stage of AD . [ 20 ] Apathi can be observ at thi stage , and remain the most persist neuropsychiatr symptom throughout the cours of the diseas . [ 23 ] The preclin stage of the diseas ha also been term mild cognit impair , [ 22 ] but whether thi term correspond to a differ diagnost stage or identifi the first step of AD is a matter of disput . [ 24 ] , In peopl with AD the increas impair of learn and memori eventu lead to a definit diagnosi . In a small portion of them , difficulti with languag , execut function , percept ( agnosia ), or execut of movement ( apraxia ) are more promin than memori problem . [ 25 ] AD doe not affect all memori capac equal . Older memori of the person ' s life ( episod memori ), fact learn ( semant memori ), and implicit memori ( the memori of the bodi on how to do thing , such as use a fork to eat ) are affect to a lesser degre than new fact or memori . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] , Languag problem are mainli characteris by a shrink vocabulari and decreas word fluenci , which lead to a gener impoverish of oral and written languag . [ 25 ] [ 28 ] In thi stage , the person with Alzheim ' s is usual capabl of adequ commun basic idea . [ 25 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] While perform fine motor task such as write , draw or dress , certain movement coordin and plan difficulti ( apraxia ) may be present but they are commonli unnot . [ 25 ] As the diseas progress , peopl with AD can often continu to perform mani task independ , but may need assist or supervis with the most cognit demand activ . [ 25 ] , Progress deterior eventu hinder independ with subject be unabl to perform most common activ of daili live . [ 25 ] Speech difficulti becom evid due to an inabl to recal vocabulari , which lead to frequent incorrect word substitut ( paraphasia ). Read and write skill are also progress lost . [ 25 ] [ 29 ] Complex motor sequenc becom less coordin as time pass and AD progress , so the risk of fall increas . [ 25 ] Dure thi phase , memori problem worsen , and the person may fail to recognis close rel . [ 25 ] Long - term memori , which wa previous intact , becom impair . [ 25 ] , Behaviour and neuropsychiatr chang becom more preval . Common manifest are wander , irrit and labil affect , lead to cri , outburst of unpremedit aggress , or resist to caregiv . [ 25 ] Sundown can also appear . [ 30 ] Approxim 30 % of peopl with AD develop illusionari misidentif and other delusion symptom . [ 25 ] Subject also lose insight of their diseas process and limit ( anosognosia ). [ 25 ] Urinari incontin can develop . [ 25 ] These symptom creat stress for rel and caretak , which can be reduc by move the person from home care to other long - term care facil . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] , Dure thi last stage of AD , the person is complet depend upon caregiv . [ 25 ] Languag is reduc to simpl phrase or even singl word , eventu lead to complet loss of speech . [ 25 ] [ 29 ] Despit the loss of verbal languag abil , peopl can often understand and return emot signal . [ 25 ] Although aggress can still be present , extrem apathi and exhaust are much more common result . [ 25 ] Peopl with AD will ultim not be abl to perform even the simplest task without assist . [ 25 ] Muscl mass and mobil deterior to the point where they are bedridden , and they lose the abil to feed themselv . [ 25 ] AD is a termin ill , with the caus of death typic be an extern factor , such as infect of pressur ulcer or pneumonia , not the diseas itself . [ 25 ] , The caus for most Alzheim ' s case is still essenti unknown [ 32 ] [ 33 ] ( except for 1 % to 5 % of case where genet differ have been identifi ). Sever compet hypothes exist tri to explain the caus of the diseas . The oldest , on which most current avail drug therapi are base , is the cholinerg hypothesi , [ 34 ] which propos that AD is caus by reduc synthesi of the neurotransmitt acetylcholin . The cholinerg hypothesi ha not maintain widespread support , larg becaus medic intend to treat acetylcholin defici have not been veri effect . Other cholinerg effect have also been propos , for exampl , initi of larg - scale aggreg of amyloid , [ 35 ] lead to generalis neuroinflamm . [ 36 ] , In 1991 , the amyloid hypothesi postul that amyloid beta ( Aβ ) deposit are the fundament caus of the diseas . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Support for thi postul come from the locat of the gene for the amyloid beta precursor protein ( APP ) on chromosom 21 , togeth with the fact that peopl with trisomi 21 ( Down Syndrom ) who have an extra gene copi almost univers exhibit AD by 40 &# 160year of age . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Also APOE4 , the major genet risk factor for AD , lead to excess amyloid buildup in the brain befor AD symptom aris . Thu , Aβ deposit preced clinic AD . [ 41 ] Further evid come from the find that transgen mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaqu and Alzheim ' s - like brain patholog with spatial learn deficit . [ 42 ] , An experiment vaccin wa found to clear the amyloid plaqu in earli human trial , but it did not have ani signific effect on dementia . [ 43 ] Research have been led to suspect non - plaqu Aβ oligom ( aggreg of mani monom ) as the primari pathogen form of Aβ . These toxic oligom , also refer to as amyloid - deriv diffus ligand ( ADDL ), bind to a surfac receptor on neuron and chang the structur of the synaps , therebi disrupt neuron commun . [ 44 ] One receptor for Aβ oligom may be the prion protein , the same protein that ha been link to mad cow diseas and the relat human condit , Creutzfeldt - Jakob diseas , thu potenti link the underli mechan of these neurodegen disord with that of Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 45 ] , In 2009 , thi theori wa updat , suggest that a close rel of the beta - amyloid protein , and not necessarili the beta - amyloid itself , may be a major culprit in the diseas . The theori hold that an amyloid - relat mechan that prune neuron connect in the brain in the fast - growth phase of earli life may be trigger by age - relat process in later life to caus the neuron wither of Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 46 ] N - APP , a fragment of APP from the peptid ' s N - terminu , is adjac to beta - amyloid and is cleav from APP by one of the same enzym . N - APP trigger the self - destruct pathway by bind to a neuron receptor call death receptor 6 ( DR6 , also known as TNFRSF21 ). [ 46 ] DR6 is highli express in the human brain region most affect by Alzheim ' s , so it is possibl that the N - APP / DR6 pathway might be hijack in the age brain to caus damag . In thi model , beta - amyloid play a complementari role , by depress synapt function . , A 2004 studi found that deposit of amyloid plaqu doe not correl well with neuron loss . [ 47 ] Thi observ support the tau hypothesi , the idea that tau protein abnorm initi the diseas cascad . [ 38 ] In thi model , hyperphosphoryl tau begin to pair with other thread of tau . Eventu , they form neurofibrillari tangl insid nerv cell bodi . [ 48 ] When thi occur , the microtubul disintegr , collaps the neuron ' s transport system . [ 49 ] Thi may result first in malfunct in biochem commun between neuron and later in the death of the cell . [ 50 ] Herp simplex viru type 1 ha also been propos to play a caus role in peopl carri the suscept version of the apo gene . [ 51 ] , Anoth hypothesi assert that the diseas may be caus by age - relat myelin breakdown in the brain . Demyelin lead to axon transport disrupt , lead to loss of neuron that becom stale . Iron releas dure myelin breakdown is hypothes to caus further damag . Homeostat myelin repair process contribut to the develop of proteinac deposit such as amyloid - beta and tau . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] , Oxid stress and dy - homeostasi of biomet ( biolog ) metabol may be signific in the format of the patholog . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] , AD individu show 70 % loss of locu coeruleu cell that provid norepinephrin ( in addit to it neurotransmitt role ) that local diffus from " varicos " as an endogen antiinflammatori agent in the microenviron around the neuron , glial cell , and blood vessel in the neocortex and hippocampu . [ 57 ] It ha been shown that norepinephrin stimul mous microglia to suppress Aβ - induc product of cytokin and their phagocytosi of Aβ . [ 57 ] Thi suggest that degener of the locu ceruleu might be respons for increas Aβ deposit in AD brain . [ 57 ] , Alzheim ' s diseas is characteris by loss of neuron and synaps in the cerebr cortex and certain subcort region . Thi loss result in gross atrophi of the affect region , includ degener in the tempor lobe and pariet lobe , and part of the frontal cortex and cingul gyru . [ 36 ] Studi use MRI and PET have document reduct in the size of specif brain region in peopl with AD as they progress from mild cognit impair to Alzheim ' s diseas , and in comparison with similar imag from healthi older adult . [ 58 ] , Both amyloid plaqu and neurofibrillari tangl are clearli visibl by microscopi in brain of those afflict by AD . [ 11 ] Plaqu are dens , mostli insolubl deposit of amyloid - beta peptid and cellular materi outsid and around neuron . Tangl ( neurofibrillari tangl ) are aggreg of the microtubul - associ protein tau which ha becom hyperphosphoryl and accumul insid the cell themselv . Although mani older individu develop some plaqu and tangl as a consequ of age , the brain of peopl with AD have a greater number of them in specif brain region such as the tempor lobe . [ 59 ] Lewi bodi are not rare in the brain of peopl with AD . [ 60 ] , Alzheim ' s diseas ha been identifi as a protein misfold diseas ( proteopathi ), caus by accumul of abnorm fold A - beta and tau protein in the brain . [ 61 ] Plaqu are made up of small peptid , 39 – 43 &# 160 amino acid in length , call beta - amyloid ( also written as A - beta or Aβ ). Beta - amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein call amyloid precursor protein ( APP ), a transmembran protein that penetr through the neuron ' s membran . APP is critic to neuron growth , surviv and post - injuri repair . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] In Alzheim ' s diseas , an unknown process caus APP to be divid into smaller fragment by enzym through proteolysi . [ 64 ] One of these fragment give rise to fibril of beta - amyloid , which form clump that deposit outsid neuron in dens format known as senil plaqu . [ 11 ] [ 65 ] , AD is also consid a tauopathi due to abnorm aggreg of the tau protein . Everi neuron ha a cytoskeleton , an intern support structur partli made up of structur call microtubul . These microtubul act like track , guid nutrient and molecul from the bodi of the cell to the end of the axon and back . A protein call tau stabil the microtubul when phosphoryl , and is therefor call a microtubul - associ protein . In AD , tau undergo chemic chang , becom hyperphosphoryl it then begin to pair with other thread , creat neurofibrillari tangl and disintegr the neuron ' s transport system . [ 66 ] , Exactli how disturb of product and aggreg of the beta amyloid peptid give rise to the patholog of AD is not known . [ 67 ] The amyloid hypothesi tradit point to the accumul of beta amyloid peptid as the central event trigger neuron degener . Accumul of aggreg amyloid fibril , which are believ to be the toxic form of the protein respons for disrupt the cell ' s calcium ion homeostasi , induc program cell death ( apoptosi ). [ 68 ] It is also known that Aβ select build up in the mitochondria in the cell of Alzheim ' s - affect brain , and it also inhibit certain enzym function and the utilis of glucos by neuron . [ 69 ] , Variou inflammatori process and cytokin may also have a role in the patholog of Alzheim ' s diseas . Inflamm is a gener marker of tissu damag in ani diseas , and may be either secondari to tissu damag in AD or a marker of an immunolog respons . [ 70 ] , Alter in the distribut of differ neurotroph factor and in the express of their receptor such as the brain deriv neurotroph factor ( BDNF ) have been describ in AD . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] , The vast major of case of Alzheim ' s diseas are sporad , mean that they are not genet inherit although some gene may act as risk factor . On the other hand , around 0 . 1 % of the case are famili form of autosom domin ( not sex - link ) inherit , which usual have an onset befor age 65 . [ 73 ] Thi form of the diseas is known as Earli onset famili Alzheim ' s diseas . , Most of autosom domin famili AD can be attribut to mutat in one of three gene : amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) and presenilin 1 and 2 . [ 74 ] Most mutat in the APP and presenilin gene increas the product of a small protein call Aβ 42 , which is the main compon of senil plaqu . [ 75 ] Some of the mutat mere alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major form — e . g ., Aβ40 — without increas Aβ42 level . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Thi suggest that presenilin mutat can caus diseas even if they lower the total amount of Aβ produc and may point to other role of presenilin or a role for alter in the function of APP and / or it fragment other than Aβ . , Most case of Alzheim ' s diseas do not exhibit autosom - domin inherit and are term sporad AD . Nevertheless genet differ may act as risk factor . The best known genet risk factor is the inherit of the ε4 allel of the apolipoprotein E ( APO ). [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Between 40 and 80 % of peopl with AD possess at least one apoE4 allel . [ 78 ] The APOEε4 allel increas the risk of the diseas by three time in heterozygot and by 15 time in homozygot . [ 73 ] Howev , it must be note that thi " genet " effect is not necessarili pure genet . For exampl , certain Nigerian popul have no relationship between presenc or dose of APOEε4 and incid or age - of - onset for Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Geneticist agre that numer other gene also act as risk factor or have protect effect that influenc the develop of late onset Alzheim ' s diseas , [ 74 ] but result such as the Nigerian studi and the incomplet penetr for all genet risk factor associ with sporad Alzheim indic a strong role for environment effect . Over 400 gene have been test for associ with late - onset sporad AD , [ 74 ] most with null result . [ 73 ] , Alzheim ' s diseas is usual diagnos clinic from the patient histori , collater histori from rel , and clinic observ , base on the presenc of characterist neurolog and neuropsycholog featur and the absenc of altern condit . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Advanc medic imag with comput tomographi ( CT ) or magnet reson imag ( MRI ), and with singl photon emiss comput tomographi ( SPECT ) or positron emiss tomographi ( PET ) can be use to help exclud other cerebr patholog or subtyp of dementia . [ 83 ] Moreov , it may predict convers from prodrom stage ( mild cognit impair ) to Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 84 ] , Assess of intellectu function includ memori test can further characteris the state of the diseas . [ 5 ] Medic organis have creat diagnost criteria to eas and standardis the diagnost process for practic physician . The diagnosi can be confirm with veri high accuraci post - mortem when brain materi is avail and can be examin histolog . [ 85 ] , The Nation Institut of Neurolog and Commun Disord and Stroke ( NINCD ) and the Alzheim ' s Diseas and Relat Disord Associ ( ADRDA , now known as the Alzheim ' s Associ ) establish the most commonli use NINCD - ADRDA Alzheim ' s Criteria for diagnosi in 1984 , [ 85 ] extens updat in 2007 . [ 86 ] These criteria requir that the presenc of cognit impair , and a suspect dementia syndrom , be confirm by neuropsycholog test for a clinic diagnosi of possibl or probabl AD . A histopatholog confirm includ a microscop examin of brain tissu is requir for a definit diagnosi . Good statist reliabl and valid have been shown between the diagnost criteria and definit histopatholog confirm . [ 87 ] Eight cognit domain are most commonli impair in AD — memori , languag , perceptu skill , attent , construct abil , orient , problem solv and function abil . These domain are equival to the NINCD - ADRDA Alzheim ' s Criteria as list in the Diagnost and Statist Manual of Mental Disord ( DSM - IV - TR ) publish by the American Psychiatr Associ . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] , Neuropsycholog test such as the mini - mental state examin ( MMSE ), are wide use to evalu the cognit impair need for diagnosi . More comprehens test array are necessari for high reliabl of result , particularli in the earliest stage of the diseas . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Neurolog examin in earli AD will usual provid normal result , except for obviou cognit impair , which may not differ from that result from other diseas process , includ other caus of dementia . , Further neurolog examin are crucial in the differenti diagnosi of AD and other diseas . [ 5 ] Interview with famili member are also utilis in the assess of the diseas . Caregiv can suppli import inform on the daili live abil , as well as on the decreas , over time , of the person ' s mental function . [ 84 ] A caregiv ' s viewpoint is particularli import , sinc a person with AD is commonli unawar of hi own deficit . [ 92 ] Mani time , famili also have difficulti in the detect of initi dementia symptom and may not commun accur inform to a physician . [ 93 ] , Anoth recent object marker of the diseas is the analysi of cerebrospin fluid for amyloid beta or tau protein , [ 94 ] both total tau protein and phosphoryl tau 181P protein concentr . [ 95 ] Search for these protein use a spinal tap can predict the onset of Alzheim ' s with a sensit of between 94 % and 100 %. [ 95 ] When use in conjunct with exist neuroimag techniqu , doctor can identifi peopl with signific memori loss who are alreadi develop the diseas . [ 95 ] Spinal fluid test are commerci avail , unlik the latest neuroimag technolog . [ 96 ] Alzheim ' s wa diagnos in one - third of the peopl who did not have ani symptom in a 2010 studi , mean that diseas progress occur well befor symptom occur . [ 97 ] , Supplement test provid extra inform on some featur of the diseas or is use to rule out other diagnos . Blood test can identifi other caus for dementia than AD [ 5 ] — caus which may , in rare case , be revers . [ 98 ] It is common to perform thyroid function test , assess B12 , rule out syphilli , rule out metabol problem ( includ test for kidney function , electrolyt level and for diabet ), assess level of heavi metal ( e . g . lead , mercuri ) and anemia . ( See differenti diagnosi for Dementia ). ( It is also necessari to rule out delirium ). , Psycholog test for depress are employ , sinc depress can either be concurr with AD ( see Depress of Alzheim diseas ), an earli sign of cognit impair , [ 99 ] or even the caus . [ 100 ] [ 101 ] , When avail as a diagnost tool , singl photon emiss comput tomographi ( SPECT ) and positron emiss tomographi ( PET ) neuroimag are use to confirm a diagnosi of Alzheim ' s in conjunct with evalu involv mental statu examin . [ 102 ] In a person alreadi have dementia , SPECT appear to be superior in differenti Alzheim ' s diseas from other possibl caus , compar with the usual attempt employ mental test and medic histori analysi . [ 103 ] Advanc have led to the propos of new diagnost criteria . [ 5 ] [ 86 ] , A new techniqu known as PiB PET ha been develop for directli and clearli imag beta - amyloid deposit in vivo use a tracer that bind select to the A - beta deposit . [ 104 ] The PiB - PET compound use carbon - 11 PET scan . Recent studi suggest that PiB - PET is 86 % accur in predict which peopl with mild cognit impair will develop Alzheim ' s diseas within two year , and 92 % accur in rule out the likelihood of develop Alzheim ' s . [ 105 ] , A similar PET scan radiopharmaceut compound call ( E )- 4 -( 2 -( 6 -( 2 -( 2 -( 2 -([ 18 F ]- fluoroethoxi ) ethoxi ) ethoxi ) pyridin - 3 - yl ) vinyl )- N - methyl benzenamin , or 18 F AV - 45 , or florbetapir - fluorin - 18 , or simpli florbetapir , contain the longer - last radionuclid fluorin - 18 , ha recent been creat , and test as a possibl diagnost tool in Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Florbetapir , like PiB , bind to beta - amyloid , but due to it use of fluorin - 18 ha a half - life of 110 minut , in contrast to PiB ' s radioact half life of 20 minut . Wong et al . found that the longer life allow the tracer to accumul significantli more in the brain of peopl with AD , particularli in the region known to be associ with beta - amyloid deposit . [ 109 ] , One review predict that amyloid imag is like to be use in conjunct with other marker rather than as an altern . [ 110 ] , Volumetr MRI can detect chang in the size of brain region . Measur those region that atrophi dure the progress of Alzheim ' s diseas is show promis as a diagnost indic . It may prove less expens than other imag method current under studi . [ 111 ] , Recent studi have shown that peopl with AD had decreas glutam ( Glu ) as well as decreas Glu / creatin ( Cr ), Glu / myo - inositol ( mI ), Glu / N - acetylaspart ( NAA ), and NAA / Cr ratio compar to normal peopl . Both decreas NAA / Cr and decreas hippocamp glutam may be an earli indic of AD . [ 112 ] , Earli research in mous model may have identifi marker for AD . The applic of these marker is unknown . [ 113 ] , A small human studi in 2011 found that monitor blood dehydroepiandrosteron ( DHEA ) variat in respons to an oxid stress could be a use proxi test : the subject with MCI did not have a DHEA variat , while the healthi control did . [ 114 ] , At present , there is no definit evid to support that ani particular measur is effect in prevent AD . [ 115 ] Global studi of measur to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produc inconsist result . Howev , epidemiolog studi have propos relationship between certain modifi factor , such as diet , cardiovascular risk , pharmaceut product , or intellectu activ among other , and a popul ' s likelihood of develop AD . Onli further research , includ clinic trial , will reveal whether these factor can help to prevent AD . [ 116 ] , Although cardiovascular risk factor , such as hypercholesterolemia , hypertens , diabet , and smoke , are associ with a higher risk of onset and cours of AD , [ 117 ] [ 118 ] statin , which are cholesterol lower drug , have not been effect in prevent or improv the cours of the diseas . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] The compon of a Mediterranean diet , which includ fruit and veget , bread , wheat and other cereal , oliv oil , fish , and red wine , may all individu or togeth reduc the risk and cours of Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 121 ] It benefici cardiovascular effect ha been propos as the mechan of action . [ 121 ] There is limit evid that light to moder use of alcohol , particularli red wine , is associ with lower risk of AD . [ 122 ] , Review on the use of vitamin have not found enough evid of efficaci to recommend vitamin C , [ 123 ] E , [ 123 ] [ 124 ] or folic acid with or without vitamin B 12 , [ 125 ] as prevent or treatment agent in AD . Addit vitamin E is associ with import health risk . [ 123 ] Trial examin folic acid ( B9 ) and other B vitamin fail to show ani signific associ with cognit declin . [ 126 ] Docosahexaeno acid , an Omega 3 fatti acid , ha not been found to slow declin . [ 127 ] , Long - term usag of non - steroid anti - inflammatori drug ( NSAID ) is associ with a reduc likelihood of develop AD . [ 128 ] Human postmortem studi , in anim model , or in vitro investig also support the notion that NSAID can reduc inflamm relat to amyloid plaqu . [ 128 ] Howev trial investig their use as palli treatment have fail to show posit result while no prevent trial ha been complet . [ 128 ] Curcumin from the curri spice turmer ha shown some effect in prevent brain damag in mous model due to it anti - inflammatori properti . [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Hormon replac therapi , although previous use , is no longer thought to prevent dementia and in some case may even be relat to it . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] There is inconsist and unconvinc evid that ginkgo ha ani posit effect on cognit impair and dementia , [ 133 ] and a recent studi conclud that it ha no effect in reduc the rate of AD incid . [ 134 ] A 21 - year studi found that coffe drinker of 3 – 5 cup per day at midlif had a 65 % reduct in risk of dementia in late - life . [ 135 ] , Peopl who engag in intellectu activ such as read , play board game , complet crossword puzzl , play music instrument , or regular social interact show a reduc risk for Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 136 ] Thi is compat with the cognit reserv theori , which state that some life experi result in more effici neural function provid the individu a cognit reserv that delay the onset of dementia manifest . [ 136 ] Educ delay the onset of AD syndrom , but is not relat to earlier death after diagnosi . [ 137 ] Learn a second languag even later in life seem to delay get Alzheim diseas . [ 138 ] Physic activ is also associ with a reduc risk of AD . [ 137 ] , Medic marijuana appear to be effect in delay Alzheim ' s Diseas . The activ ingredi in marijuana , THC , prevent the format of deposit in the brain associ with Alzheim ' s diseas . THC wa found to inhibit acetylcholinesteras more effect than commerci market drug . THC wa also found to delay amylogenesi . [ 139 ] [ 140 ] , Some studi have shown an increas risk of develop AD with environment factor such the intak of metal , particularli aluminium , [ 141 ] [ 142 ] or exposur to solvent . [ 143 ] The qualiti of some of these studi ha been criticis , [ 144 ] and other studi have conclud that there is no relationship between these environment factor and the develop of AD . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] , While some studi suggest that extrem low frequenc electromagnet field may increas the risk for Alzheim ' s diseas , review found that further epidemiolog and laboratori investig of thi hypothesi are need . [ 149 ] Smoke is a signific AD risk factor . [ 150 ] System marker of the innat immun system are risk factor for late - onset AD . [ 151 ] , There is no cure for Alzheim ' s diseas avail treatment offer rel small symptomat benefit but remain palli in natur . Current treatment can be divid into pharmaceut , psychosoci and caregiv . , Four medic are current approv by regulatori agenc such as the U . S . Food and Drug Administr ( FDA ) and the European Medicin Agenc ( EMA ) to treat the cognit manifest of AD : three are acetylcholinesteras inhibitor and the other is memantin , an NMDA receptor antagonist . No drug ha an indic for delay or halt the progress of the diseas . , Reduct in the activ of the cholinerg neuron is a well - known featur of Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 152 ] Acetylcholinesteras inhibitor are employ to reduc the rate at which acetylcholin ( ACh ) is broken down , therebi increas the concentr of ACh in the brain and combat the loss of ACh caus by the death of cholinerg neuron . [ 153 ] As of 2008 [ updat ] , the cholinesteras inhibitor approv for the manag of AD symptom are donepezil ( brand name Aricept ), [ 154 ] galantamin ( Razadyn ), [ 155 ] and rivastigmin ( brand as Exelon [ 156 ] and Exelon Patch [ 157 ] ). There is evid for the efficaci of these medic in mild to moder Alzheim ' s diseas , [ 158 ] [ 159 ] and some evid for their use in the advanc stage . Onli donepezil is approv for treatment of advanc AD dementia . [ 160 ] The use of these drug in mild cognit impair ha not shown ani effect in a delay of the onset of AD . [ 161 ] The most common side effect are nausea and vomit , both of which are link to cholinerg excess . These side effect aris in approxim 10 – 20 % of user and are mild to moder in sever . Less common secondari effect includ muscl cramp , decreas heart rate ( bradycardia ), decreas appetit and weight , and increas gastric acid product . [ 162 ] , Glutam is a use excitatori neurotransmitt of the nervou system , although excess amount in the brain can lead to cell death through a process call excitotox which consist of the overstimul of glutam receptor . Excitotox occur not onli in Alzheim ' s diseas , but also in other neurolog diseas such as Parkinson ' s diseas and multipl sclerosi . [ 163 ] Memantin ( brand name Akatinol , Axura , Ebixa / Abixa , Memox and Namenda ), [ 164 ] is a noncompetit NMDA receptor antagonist first use as an anti - influenza agent . It act on the glutamaterg system by block NMDA receptor and inhibit their overstimul by glutam . [ 163 ] Memantin ha been shown to be moder efficaci in the treatment of moder to sever Alzheim ' s diseas . It effect in the initi stage of AD are unknown . [ 165 ] Report advers event with memantin are infrequ and mild , includ hallucin , confus , dizzi , headach and fatigu . [ 166 ] The combin of memantin and donepezil ha been shown to be " of statist signific but clinic margin effect ". [ 167 ] , Antipsychot drug are modestli use in reduc aggress and psychosi in Alzheim ' s diseas with behaviour problem , but are associ with seriou advers effect , such as cerebrovascular event , movement difficulti or cognit declin , that do not permit their routin use . [ 168 ] [ 169 ] When use in the long - term , they have been shown to associ with increas mortal . [ 169 ] , Peopl with Alzheim ’ s diseas who have taken Huperzin A may have improv gener cognit function , global clinic statu , function perform and reduc behaviour disturb compar to peopl take placebo , accord to a Cochran Review , howev , the poor methodolog qualiti of the small trial , includ problem with blind and random , led review to conclud " There is current insuffici evid of the effect of Huperzin A for Alzheim ' s diseas ( AD )." [ 170 ] , Psychosoci intervent are use as an adjunct to pharmaceut treatment and can be classifi within behaviour -, emot -, cognit - or stimul - orient approach . Research on efficaci is unavail and rare specif to AD , focus instead on dementia in gener . [ 171 ] , Behaviour intervent attempt to identifi and reduc the anteced and consequ of problem behaviour . Thi approach ha not shown success in improv overal function , [ 172 ] but can help to reduc some specif problem behaviour , such as incontin . [ 173 ] There is a lack of high qualiti data on the effect of these techniqu in other behaviour problem such as wander . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] , Emot - orient intervent includ reminisc therapi , valid therapi , support psychotherapi , sensori integr , also call snoezelen , and simul presenc therapi . Support psychotherapi ha receiv littl or no formal scientif studi , but some clinician find it use in help mildli impair peopl adjust to their ill . [ 171 ] Reminisc therapi ( RT ) involv the discuss of past experi individu or in group , mani time with the aid of photograph , household item , music and sound record , or other familiar item from the past . Although there are few qualiti studi on the effect of RT , it may be benefici for cognit and mood . [ 176 ] Simul presenc therapi ( SPT ) is base on attach theori and involv play a record with voic of the closest rel of the person with Alzheim ' s diseas . There is partial evid indic that SPT may reduc challeng behaviour . [ 177 ] Final , valid therapi is base on accept of the realiti and person truth of anoth ' s experi , while sensori integr is base on exercis aim to stimul sens . There is littl evid to support the use of these therapi . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] , The aim of cognit - orient treatment , which includ realiti orient and cognit retrain , is the reduct of cognit deficit . Realiti orient consist in the present of inform about time , place or person in order to eas the understand of the person about it surround and hi or her place in them . On the other hand cognit retrain tri to improv impair capac by exercit of mental abil . Both have shown some efficaci improv cognit capac , [ 180 ] [ 181 ] although in some studi these effect were transient and neg effect , such as frustrat , have also been report . [ 171 ] , Stimul - orient treatment includ art , music and pet therapi , exercis , and ani other kind of recreat activ . Stimul ha modest support for improv behaviour , mood , and , to a lesser extent , function . Nevertheless , as import as these effect are , the main support for the use of stimul therapi is the chang in the person ' s routin . [ 171 ] , Sinc Alzheim ' s ha no cure and it gradual render peopl incap of tend for their own need , caregiv essenti is the treatment and must be care manag over the cours of the diseas . , Dure the earli and moder stage , modif to the live environ and lifestyl can increas patient safeti and reduc caretak burden . [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Exampl of such modif are the adher to simplifi routin , the place of safeti lock , the label of household item to cue the person with the diseas or the use of modifi daili life object . [ 171 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] The patient may also becom incap of feed themselv , so they requir food in smaller piec or pure . [ 186 ] When swallow difficulti aris , the use of feed tube may be requir . In such case , the medic efficaci and ethic of continu feed is an import consider of the caregiv and famili member . [ 187 ] [ 188 ] The use of physic restraint is rare indic in ani stage of the diseas , although there are situat when they are necessari to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregiv . [ 171 ] , As the diseas progress , differ medic issu can appear , such as oral and dental diseas , pressur ulcer , malnutrit , hygien problem , or respiratori , skin , or eye infect . Care manag can prevent them , while profession treatment is need when they do aris . [ 189 ] [ 190 ] Dure the final stage of the diseas , treatment is centr on reliev discomfort until death . [ 191 ] , A small recent studi in the US conclud that peopl whose caregiv had a realist understand of the prognosi and clinic complic of late dementia were less like to receiv aggress treatment near the end of life . [ 192 ] , There is strong evid that feed tube do not help peopl with advanc Alzheim ' s dementia gain weight , regain strength or function , prevent aspir pneumonia , or improv qualiti of life . [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] [ 196 ] , The earli stage of Alzheim ' s diseas are difficult to diagnos . A definit diagnosi is usual made onc cognit impair compromis daili live activ , although the person may still be live independ . The symptom will progress from mild cognit problem , such as memori loss through increas stage of cognit and non - cognit disturb , elimin ani possibl of independ live . [ 25 ] , Life expect of the popul with the diseas is reduc . [ 9 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] The mean life expect follow diagnosi is approxim seven year . [ 9 ] Fewer than 3 % of peopl live more than fourteen year . [ 10 ] Diseas featur significantli associ with reduc surviv are an increas sever of cognit impair , decreas function level , histori of fall , and disturb in the neurolog examin . Other coincid diseas such as heart problem , diabet or histori of alcohol abus are also relat with shorten surviv . [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total surviv year , life expect is particularli reduc when compar to the healthi popul among those who are younger . [ 198 ] Men have a less favour surviv prognosi than women . [ 10 ] [ 201 ] , The diseas is the underli caus of death in 70 % of all case . [ 9 ] Pneumonia and dehydr are the most frequent immedi caus of death , while cancer is a less frequent caus of death than in the gener popul . [ 9 ] [ 201 ] , Two main measur are use in epidemiolog studi : incid and preval . Incid is the number of new case per unit of person – time at risk ( usual number of new case per thousand person – year ) while preval is the total number of case of the diseas in the popul at ani given time . , Regard incid , cohort longitudin studi ( studi where a diseas - free popul is follow over the year ) provid rate between 10 and 15 per thousand person – year for all dementia and 5 – 8 for AD , [ 202 ] [ 203 ] which mean that half of new dementia case each year are AD . Advanc age is a primari risk factor for the diseas and incid rate are not equal for all age : everi five year after the age of 65 , the risk of acquir the diseas approxim doubl , increas from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person year . [ 202 ] [ 203 ] There are also sex differ in the incid rate , women have a higher risk of develop AD particularli in the popul older than 85 . [ 203 ] [ 204 ] , Preval of AD in popul is depend upon differ factor includ incid and surviv . Sinc the incid of AD increas with age , it is particularli import to includ the mean age of the popul of interest . In the Unit State , Alzheim preval wa estim to be 1 . 6 % in 2000 both overal and in the 65 – 74 age group , with the rate increas to 19 % in the 75 – 84 group and to 42 % in the greater than 84 group . [ 205 ] Preval rate in less develop region are lower . [ 206 ] The World Health Organ estim that in 2005 , 0 . 379 % of peopl worldwid had dementia , and that the preval would increas to 0 . 441 % in 2015 and to 0 . 556 % in 2030 . [ 207 ] Other studi have reach similar conclus . [ 206 ] Anoth studi estim that in 2006 , 0 . 40 % of the world popul ( rang 0 . 17 – 0 . 89 % absolut number 26 . 6 million , rang 11 . 4 – 59 . 4 million ) were afflict by AD , and that the preval rate would tripl and the absolut number would quadrupl by 2050 . [ 3 ] , The ancient Greek and Roman philosoph and physician associ old age with increas dementia . [ 1 ] It wa not until 1901 that German psychiatrist Aloi Alzheim identifi the first case of what becam known as Alzheim ' s diseas in a fifti - year - old woman he call August D . Alzheim follow her until she die in 1906 , when he first report the case publicli . [ 208 ] Dure the next five year , eleven similar case were report in the medic literatur , some of them alreadi use the term Alzheim ' s diseas . [ 1 ] The diseas wa first describ as a distinct diseas by Emil Kraepelin after suppress some of the clinic ( delus and hallucin ) and patholog featur ( arteriosclerot chang ) contain in the origin report of August D . [ 209 ] He includ Alzheim ' s diseas , also name presenil dementia by Kraepelin , as a subtyp of senil dementia in the eighth edit of hi Textbook of Psychiatri , publish on Juli 15 , 1910 . [ 210 ] , For most of the 20th centuri , the diagnosi of Alzheim ' s diseas wa reserv for individu between the age of 45 and 65 who develop symptom of dementia . The terminolog chang after 1977 when a confer on AD conclud that the clinic and patholog manifest of presenil and senil dementia were almost ident , although the author also ad that thi did not rule out the possibl that they had differ caus . [ 211 ] Thi eventu led to the diagnosi of Alzheim ' s diseas independ of age . [ 212 ] The term senil dementia of the Alzheim type ( SDAT ) wa use for a time to describ the condit in those over 65 , with classic Alzheim ' s diseas be use for those younger . Eventu , the term Alzheim ' s diseas wa formal adopt in medic nomenclatur to describ individu of all age with a characterist common symptom pattern , diseas cours , and neuropatholog . [ 213 ] , Dementia , and specif Alzheim ' s diseas , may be among the most costli diseas for societi in Europ and the Unit State , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] while their cost in other countri such as Argentina , [ 214 ] or South Korea , [ 215 ] is also high and rise . These cost will probabl increas with the age of societi , becom an import social problem . AD - associ cost includ direct medic cost such as nurs home care , direct nonmed cost such as in - home day care , and indirect cost such as lost product of both patient and caregiv . [ 19 ] Number vari between studi but dementia cost worldwid have been calcul around $ 160 &# 160billion , [ 216 ] while cost of Alzheim in the Unit State may be $ 100 &# 160billion each year . [ 19 ] , The greatest origin of cost for societi is the long - term care by health care profession and particularli institutionalis , which correspond to 2 / 3 of the total cost for societi . [ 18 ] The cost of live at home is also veri high , [ 18 ] especi when inform cost for the famili , such as caregiv time and caregiv ' s lost earn , are taken into account . [ 217 ] , Cost increas with dementia sever and the presenc of behaviour disturb , [ 218 ] and are relat to the increas caregiv time requir for the provis of physic care . [ 217 ] Therefor ani treatment that slow cognit declin , delay institutionalis or reduc caregiv ' hour will have econom benefit . Econom evalu of current treatment have shown posit result . [ 19 ] , The role of the main caregiv is often taken by the spous or a close rel . [ 14 ] Alzheim ' s diseas is known for place a great burden on caregiv which includ social , psycholog , physic or econom aspect . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Home care is usual prefer by peopl with AD and their famili . [ 219 ] Thi option also delay or elimin the need for more profession and costli level of care . [ 219 ] [ 220 ] Nevertheless two - third of nurs home resid have dementia . [ 171 ] , Dementia caregiv are subject to high rate of physic and mental disord . [ 221 ] Factor associ with greater psychosoci problem of the primari caregiv includ have an affect person at home , the carer be a spous , demand behaviour of the care person such as depress , behaviour disturb , hallucin , sleep problem or walk disrupt and social isol . [ 222 ] [ 223 ] Regard econom problem , famili caregiv often give up time from work to spend 47 &# 160hour per week on averag with the person with AD , while the cost of care for them are high . Direct and indirect cost of care for an Alzheim ' s patient averag between $ 18 , 000 and $ 77 , 500 per year in the Unit State , depend on the studi . [ 14 ] [ 217 ] , Cognit behaviour therapi and the teach of cope strategi either individu or in group have demonstr their efficaci in improv caregiv ' psycholog health . [ 15 ] [ 224 ] , As Alzheim ' s diseas is highli preval , mani notabl peopl have develop it . Well - known exampl are former Unit State Presid Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iri Murdoch , both of whom were the subject of scientif articl examin how their cognit capac deterior with the diseas . [ 225 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] Other case includ the retir footbal Ferenc Puska , [ 228 ] the former Prime Minist Harold Wilson ( Unit Kingdom ) and Adolfo Suárez ( Spain ), [ 229 ] [ 230 ] the actress Rita Hayworth , [ 231 ] the actor Charlton Heston , [ 232 ] the novelist Terri Pratchett , [ 233 ] Indian politician Georg Fernand , [ 234 ] and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physic recipi Charl K . Kao . [ 235 ] , AD ha also been portray in film such as : Iri ( 2001 ), [ 236 ] base on John Bayley ' s memoir of hi wife Iri Murdoch [ 237 ] The Notebook ( 2004 ), [ 238 ] base on Nichola Spark ' 1996 novel of the same name [ 239 ] A Moment to Rememb ( 2004 ) Thanmathra ( 2005 ) [ 240 ] Memori of Tomorrow ( Ashita no Kioku ) ( 2006 ), [ 241 ] base on Hiroshi Ogiwara ' s novel of the same name [ 242 ] Away from Her ( 2006 ), base on Alic Munro ' s short stori " The Bear Came over the Mountain ". [ 243 ] Documentari on Alzheim ' s diseas includ Malcolm and Barbara : A Love Stori ( 1999 ) and Malcolm and Barbara : Love ' s Farewel ( 2007 ), both featur Malcolm Pointon . [ 244 ] , As of 2010 [ updat ] , the safeti and efficaci of more than 400 pharmaceut treatment had been or were be investig in 858 clinic trial worldwid , and approxim a quarter of these compound are in Phase &# 160III trial the last step prior to review by regulatori agenc . [ 245 ] , One area of clinic research is focus on treat the underli diseas patholog . Reduct of amyloid beta level is a common target of compound [ 246 ] ( such as apomorphin ) under investig . Immunotherapi or vaccin for the amyloid protein is one treatment modal under studi . [ 247 ] Unlik prevent vaccin , the put therapi would be use to treat peopl alreadi diagnos . It is base upon the concept of train the immun system to recognis , attack , and revers deposit of amyloid , therebi alter the cours of the diseas . [ 248 ] An exampl of such a vaccin under investig wa ACC - 001 , [ 249 ] [ 250 ] although the trial were suspend in 2008 . [ 251 ] Anoth similar agent is bapineuzumab , an antibodi design as ident to the natur induc anti - amyloid antibodi . [ 252 ] Other approach are neuroprotect agent , such as AL - 108 , [ 253 ] and metal - protein interact attenu agent , such as PBT2 . [ 254 ] A TNFα receptor fusion protein , etanercept ha show encourag result . [ 255 ] , In 2008 , two separ clinic trial show posit result in modifi the cours of diseas in mild to moder AD with methylthioninium chlorid ( trade name rember ), a drug that inhibit tau aggreg , [ 256 ] [ 257 ] and dimebon , an antihistamin . [ 258 ] The consecut Phase - III trial of Dimebon fail to show posit effect in the primari and secondari endpoint . [ 259 ] , The possibl that AD could be treat with antivir medic is suggest by a studi show coloc of herp simplex viru with amyloid plaqu . [ 260 ] , Preliminari research on the effect of medit on retriev memori and cognit function have been encourag . Limit of thi research can be address in futur studi with more detail analys . [ 261 ] , An FDA panel vote unanim to recommend approv of florbetapir ( tradenam : Amyvid ), which is current use in an investig studi .

"[ Apoptosi ( &# 160 / ˌ æ p ə ˈ t oʊ s ɪ s / ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is the process of program cell death ( PCD ) that may occur in multicellular organ . [ 3 ] Biochem event lead to characterist cell chang ( morpholog ) and death . These chang includ bleb , cell shrinkag , nuclear fragment , chromatin condens , and chromosom DNA fragment . ( See also Apoptosi DNA fragment .) Unlik necrosi , apoptosi produc cell fragment call apoptot bodi that phagocyt cell are abl to engulf and quickli remov befor the content of the cell can spill out onto surround cell and caus damag . [ 4 ] , In contrast to necrosi , which is a form of traumat cell death that result from acut cellular injuri , apoptosi , in gener , confer advantag dure an organ ' s life cycl . For exampl , the differenti of finger and toe in a develop human embryo occur becaus cell between the finger apoptos the result is that the digit are separ . Between 50 and 70 billion cell die each day due to apoptosi in the averag human adult . For an averag child between the age of 8 and 14 , approxim 20 billion to 30 billion cell die a day . [ 5 ] , Research in and around apoptosi ha increas substanti sinc the earli 1990 . In addit to it import as a biolog phenomenon , defect apoptot process have been implic in an extens varieti of diseas . Excess apoptosi caus atrophi , wherea an insuffici amount result in uncontrol cell prolifer , such as cancer . , German scientist Carl Vogt wa first to describ the principl of apoptosi in 1842 . In 1885 , anatomist Walther Flem deliv a more precis descript of the process of program cell death . Howev , it wa not until 1965 that the topic wa resurrect . While studi tissu use electron microscopi , John Foxton Ross Kerr at Univers of Queensland wa abl to distinguish apoptosi ( Greek : apo - from / off / without , ptosi - fall ) from traumat cell death . [ 6 ] Follow the public of a paper describ the phenomenon , Kerr wa invit to join Alastair R Curri , as well as Andrew Wylli , who wa Curri ' s graduat student , [ 7 ] at Univers of Aberdeen . In 1972 , the trio publish a semin articl in the British Journal of Cancer . [ 8 ] Kerr had initi use the term program cell necrosi , but in the articl , the process of natur cell death wa call apoptosi . Kerr , Wylli and Curri credit Jame Cormack , a professor of Greek languag at Univers of Aberdeen , with suggest the term apoptosi . Kerr receiv the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedt Prize on March 14 , 2000 , for hi descript of apoptosi . He share the prize with Boston biologist Robert Horvitz . [ 9 ] The 2002 Nobel Prize in Medicin wa award to Sydney Brenner , Horvitz and John E . Sulston for their work regard apoptosi . , In Greek , apoptosi translat to the " drop off " of petal or leav from plant or tree . Cormack , professor of Greek languag , reintroduc the term for medic use as it had a medic mean for the Greek over two thousand year befor . Hippocr use the term to mean " the fall off of the bone ". Galen extend it mean to " the drop of the scab ". Cormack wa no doubt awar of thi usag when he suggest the name . Debat continu over the correct pronunci , with opinion divid between a pronunci with the second p silent ( / æ p ə ˈ t oʊ s ɨ s / ap - ə - toh - si [ 1 ] [ 10 ] ) and the second p pronounc ( / æ p ə p ˈ t oʊ s ɨ s / ), [ 1 ] [ 11 ] as in the origin Greek . [ citat need ] In English , the p of the Greek - pt - conson cluster is typic silent at the begin of a word ( e . g . pterodactyl , Ptolemi ), but articul when use in combin form preced by a vowel , as in helicopt or the order of insect : diptera , lepidoptera , etc . , In the origin Kerr Wylli and Curri paper , British Journal of Cancer , 1972 Aug26 ( 4 ): 239 - 57 , there is a footnot regard the pronunci : , " We are most grate to Professor Jame Cormack of the Depart of Greek , Univers of Aberdeen , for suggest thi term . The word " apoptosi " ( ἁπόπτωσισ ) is use in Greek to describ the " drop off " or " fall off " of petal from flower , or leav from tree . To show the deriv clearli , we propos that the stress should be on the penultim syllabl , the second half of the word be pronounc like " ptosi " ( with the " p " silent ), which come from the same root " to fall ", and is alreadi use to describ the droop of the upper eyelid ." , The process of apoptosi is control by a divers rang of cell signal , which may origin either extracellularli ( extrins induc ) or intracellularli ( intrins induc ). Extracellular signal may includ toxin , [ 12 ] hormon , growth factor , nitric oxid [ 13 ] or cytokin , that must either cross the plasma membran or transduc to effect a respons . These signal may posit ( i . e ., trigger ) or neg ( i . e ., repress , inhibit , or dampen ) affect apoptosi . ( Bind and subsequ trigger of apoptosi by a molecul is term posit induct , wherea the activ repress or inhibit of apoptosi by a molecul is term neg inductio n .) , A cell initi intracellular apoptot signal in respons to a stress , which may bring about cell suicid . The bind of nuclear receptor by glucocorticoid , [ 14 ] heat , [ 14 ] radiat , [ 14 ] nutrient depriv , [ 14 ] viral infect , [ 14 ] hypoxia [ 14 ] and increas intracellular calcium concentr , [ 15 ] for exampl , by damag to the membran , can all trigger the releas of intracellular apoptot signal by a damag cell . A number of cellular compon , such as poli ADP ribos polymeras , may also help regul apoptosi . [ 16 ] , Befor the actual process of cell death is precipit by enzym , apoptot signal must caus regulatori protein to initi the apoptosi pathway . Thi step allow apoptot signal to caus cell death , or the process to be stop , should the cell no longer need to die . Sever protein are involv , but two main method of regul have been identifi : target mitochondria function , or directli transduc the signal via adaptor protein to the apoptot mechan . Anoth extrins pathway for initi identifi in sever toxin studi is an increas in calcium concentr within a cell caus by drug activ , which also can caus apoptosi via a calcium bind proteas calpain . , The mitochondria are essenti to multicellular life .&# 160 Without them , a cell ceas to respir aerob and quickli die , a fact exploit by some apoptot pathway .&# 160 Apoptot protein that target mitochondria affect them in differ way .&# 160 They may caus mitochondri swell through the format of membran pore , or they may increas the permeabl of the mitochondri membran and caus apoptot effector to leak out . [ 14 ] &# 160 There is also a grow bodi of evid indic that nitric oxid is abl to induc apoptosi by help to dissip the membran potenti of mitochondria and therefor make it more permeabl . [ 13 ] , Mitochondri protein known as SMAC ( small mitochondria - deriv activ of caspas ) are releas into the cytosol follow an increas in permeabl .&# 160 SMAC bind to inhibitor of apoptosi protein ( IAP ) and deactiv them , prevent the IAP from arrest the apoptot process and therefor allow apoptosi to proceed .&# 160 IAP also normal suppress the activ of a group of cystein proteas call caspas , [ 17 ] which carri out the degrad of the cell , therefor the actual degrad enzym can be seen to be indirectli regul by mitochondri permeabl . , Cytochrom c is also releas from mitochondria due to format of a channel , the mitochondri apoptosi - induc channel ( MAC ), in the outer mitochondri membran , [ 18 ] and serv a regulatori function as it preced morpholog chang associ with apoptosi . [ 14 ] &# 160 Onc cytochrom c is releas it bind with Apoptot proteas activ factor - 1 ( Apaf - 1 ) and ATP , which then bind to pro - caspas - 9 to creat a protein complex known as an apoptosom .&# 160 The apoptosom cleav the pro - caspas to it activ form of caspas - 9 , which in turn activ the effector caspas - 3 . , MAC , also call " Mitochondri Outer Membran Permeabil Pore " is regul by variou protein , such as those encod by the mammalian Bcl - 2 famili of anti - apoptop gene , the homolog of the ced - 9 gene found in C . elegan . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] &# 160 Bcl - 2 protein are abl to promot or inhibit apoptosi by direct action on MAC / MOMPP .&# 160 Bax and / or Bak form the pore , while Bcl - 2 , Bcl - xL or Mcl - 1 inhibit it format . , Two theori of the direct initi of apoptot mechan in mammal have been suggest : the TNF - induc ( tumour necrosi factor ) model and the Fa - Fa ligand - mediat model , both involv receptor of the TNF receptor ( TNFR ) famili [ 21 ] coupl to extrins signal . , TNF is a cytokin produc mainli by activ macrophag , and is the major extrins mediat of binari hipalopt apoptosi . Most cell in the human bodi have two receptor for TNF : TNF - R1 and TNF - R2 . The bind of TNF to TNF - R1 ha been shown to initi the pathway that lead to caspas activ via the intermedi membran protein TNF receptor - associ death domain ( TRADD ) and Fa - associ death domain protein ( FADD ). [ 22 ] Bind of thi receptor can also indirectli lead to the activ of transcript factor involv in cell surviv and inflammatori respons . [ 23 ] The link between TNF and apoptosi show whi an abnorm product of TNF play a fundament role in sever human diseas , especi in autoimmun diseas . , The Fa receptor ( also known as Apo - 1 or CD95 ) bind the Fa ligand ( FasL ), a transmembran protein part of the TNF famili . [ 21 ] The interact between Fa and FasL result in the format of the death - induc signal complex ( DISC ), which contain the FADD , caspas - 8 and caspas - 10 . In some type of cell ( type I ), process caspas - 8 directli activ other member of the caspas famili , and trigger the execut of apoptosi of the cell . In other type of cell ( type II ), the Fa - DISC start a feedback loop that spiral into increas releas of pro - apoptot factor from mitochondria and the amplifi activ of caspas - 8 . [ 24 ] , Follow TNF - R1 and Fa activ in mammalian cell a balanc between pro - apoptot ( BAX , [ 25 ] BID , BAK , or BAD ) and anti - apoptot ( Bcl - Xl and Bcl - 2 ) member of the Bcl - 2 famili is establish . Thi balanc is the proport of pro - apoptot homodim that form in the outer - membran of the mitochondrion . The pro - apoptot homodim are requir to make the mitochondri membran permeabl for the releas of caspas activ such as cytochrom c and SMAC . Control of pro - apoptot protein under normal cell condit of non - apoptot cell is incomplet understood , but in gener , Bax or Bak are activ by the activ of BH3 - onli protein , part of the Bcl - 2 famili . , Caspas play the central role in the transduct of DR apoptot signal . Caspas are protein that are highli conserv , cystein - depend aspart - specif proteas . There are two type of caspas : initi caspas , caspas 8 , 10 , 9 , 2 , and effector caspas , caspas 3 , 7 , 6 . The activ of initi caspas requir bind to specif oligomer adaptor protein . Effector caspas are then activ by these activ initi caspas through proteolyt cleavag . The activ effector caspas then proteolyt degrad a host of intracellular protein to carri out the cell death program . , There also exist a caspas - independ apoptot pathway that is mediat by AIF ( apoptosi - induc factor ). [ 26 ] , Mani pathway and signal lead to apoptosi , but there is onli one mechan that actual caus the death of a cell . [ citat need ] After a cell receiv stimulu , it undergo organ degrad of cellular organel by activ proteolyt caspas . A cell undergo apoptosi show a characterist morpholog : , Apoptosi progress quickli and it product are quickli remov , make it difficult to detect or visual . Dure karyorrhexi , endonucleas activ leav short DNA fragment , regularli space in size . These give a characterist " ladder " appear on agar gel after electrophoresi . Test for DNA ladder differenti apoptosi from ischem or toxic cell death . [ 30 ] , The remov of dead cell by neighbor phagocyt cell ha been term efferocytosi . [ 31 ] Die cell that undergo the final stage of apoptosi display phagocytot molecul , such as phosphatidylserin , on their cell surfac . [ 32 ] Phosphatidylserin is normal found on the cytosol surfac of the plasma membran , but is redistribut dure apoptosi to the extracellular surfac by a hypothet protein known as scramblas . [ 33 ] These molecul mark the cell for phagocytosi by cell possess the appropri receptor , such as macrophag . [ 34 ] Upon recognit , the phagocyt reorgan it cytoskeleton for engulf of the cell . The remov of die cell by phagocyt occur in an orderli manner without elicit an inflammatori respons . , Mani knock - out have been made in the apoptosi pathway to test the function of each of the protein .&# 160 Sever caspas , in addit to APAF - 1 and FADD , have been mutat to determin the new phenotyp .&# 160 In order to creat a tumor necrosi factor ( TNF ) knockout , an exon contain the nucleotid 3704 - 5364 wa remov from the gene .&# 160 Thi exon encod a portion of the matur TNF domain , as well as the leader sequenc which is a highli conserv region necessari for proper intracellular process .&# 160 TNF -/- mice develop normal and have no gross structur or morpholog abnorm .&# 160 Howev , upon immun with SRBC ( sheep red blood cell ), these mice demonstr a defici in the matur of an antibodi respons they were abl to gener normal level of IgM , but could not develop specif IgG level .&# 160 Apaf - 1 is the protein that turn on caspas 9 by cleavag to begin the caspas cascad that lead to apoptosi .&# 160 Sinc a -/- mutat in the APAF - 1 gene is embryon lethal , a gene trap strategi wa use in order to gener an APAF - 1 -/- mous .&# 160 Thi assay is use to disrupt gene function by creat an intragen gene fusion .&# 160 When an APAF - 1 gene trap is introduc into cell , mani morpholog chang occur , such as spina bifida , the persist of interdigit web , and open brain .&# 160 Addit , after embryon day 12 . 5 , the brain of the embryo show sever structur chang .&# 160 Interestingli , APAF - 1 cell are protect from apoptosi stimuli such as irradi .&# 160 A BAX - 1 knock - out mous exhibit normal forebrain format and a decreas program cell death in some neuron popul and in the spinal cord , lead to an increas in motor neuron . , The caspas protein are integr part of the apoptosi pathway , so it follow that knock - out made have vari damag result .&# 160 A caspas 9 knock - out lead to a sever brain malform .&# 160 A caspas 8 knock - out lead to cardiac failur and thu embryon lethal .&# 160 Howev , with the use of cre - lox technolog , a caspas 8 knock - out ha been creat that exhibit an increas in peripher T cell , an impair T cell respons , and a defect in neural tube closur .&# 160 Interestingli , these mice were found to be resist to apoptosi mediat by CD95 , TNFR , etc . but not resist to apoptosi caus by UV irradi , chemotherapeut drug , and other stimuli .&# 160 Final , a caspas 3 knock - out wa character by ectop cell mass in the brain and abnorm apoptot featur such as membran bleb or nuclear fragment .&# 160 A remark featur of these KO mice is that they have a veri restrict phenotyp : Casp3 , 9 , APAF - 1 KO mice have deform of neural tissu and FADD and Casp 8 KO show defect heart develop , howev in both type of KO other organ develop normal and some cell type were still sensit to apoptot stimuli suggest that unknown pro - apoptot pathway exist . , The mani differ type of apoptot pathway contain a multitud of differ biochem compon , mani of them not yet understood . [ 35 ] As a pathway is more or less sequenti in natur , it is a victim of causal remov or modifi one compon lead to an effect in anoth . In a live organ thi can have disastr effect , often in the form of diseas or disord . A discuss of everi diseas caus by modif of the variou apoptot pathway would be impract , but the concept overli each one is the same : the normal function of the pathway ha been disrupt in such a way as to impair the abil of the cell to undergo normal apoptosi . Thi result in a cell that live past it " use - by - date " and is abl to replic and pass on ani faulti machineri to it progeni , increas the likelihood of the cell becom cancer or diseas . , A recent - describ exampl of thi concept in action can be seen in the develop of a lung cancer call NCI - H460 . [ 36 ] The X - link inhibitor of apoptosi protein ( XIAP ) is overexpress in cell of the H460 cell line . XIAP bind to the process form of caspas - 9 , and suppress the activ of apoptot activ cytochrom c , therefor overexpress lead to a decreas in the amount of pro - apoptot agonist . As a consequ , the balanc of anti - apoptot and pro - apoptot effector is upset in favour of the former , and the damag cell continu to replic despit be direct to die . , The tumor - suppressor protein p53 accumul when DNA is damag due to a chain of biochem factor . Part of thi pathway includ alpha - interferon and beta - interferon , which induc transcript of the p53 gene and result in the increas of p53 protein level and enhanc of cancer cell - apoptosi . [ 37 ] p53 prevent the cell from replic by stop the cell cycl at G1 , or interphas , to give the cell time to repair , howev it will induc apoptosi if damag is extens and repair effort fail . Ani disrupt to the regul of the p53 or interferon gene will result in impair apoptosi and the possibl format of tumor . , Inhibit of apoptosi can result in a number of cancer , autoimmun diseas , inflammatori diseas , and viral infect . It wa origin believ that the associ accumul of cell wa due to an increas in cellular prolifer , but it is now known that it is also due to a decreas in cell death . The most common of these diseas is cancer , the diseas of excess cellular prolifer , which is oftentim character by an overexpress of IAP famili member . As a result , the malign cell experi an abnorm respons to apoptosi induct : cycl regul gene ( such as p53 , ra or c - myc ) are mutat or inactiv in diseas cell , and further gene ( such as bcl - 2 ) also modifi their express in tumor . , The main method of treatment for death signal - relat diseas involv either increas or decreas the suscept of apoptosi in diseas cell , depend on whether the diseas is caus by either the inhibit of or excess apoptosi . For instanc , treatment aim to restor apoptosi to treat diseas with defici cell death , and to increas the apoptot threshold to treat diseas involv with excess cell death . To stimul apoptosi , one can increas the number of death receptor ligand ( such as TNF or TRAIL ), antagon the anti - apoptot Bcl - 2 pathway , or introduc Smac mimet to inhibit the inhibitor ( IAP ). The addit of agent such as Herceptin , Iressa or Gleevec work to stop cell from cycl and caus apoptosi activ by block growth and surviv signal further upstream . Final , ad p53 - MDM2 complex displac p53 and activ the p53 pathway , lead to cell cycl arrest and apoptosi . Mani differ method can be use to stimul apoptosi in variou place along the death signal pathway . , On the other hand , loss of control of cell death ( result in excess apoptosi ) can lead to neurodegen diseas , hematolog diseas , and tissu damag . The progress of HIV is directli link to excess , unregul apoptosi . In a healthi individu , the number of CD4 + lymphocyt is in balanc with the cell gener by the bone marrow howev , in HIV - posit patient , thi balanc is lost due to an inabl of the bone marrow to regener CD4 + cell . In the case of HIV , CD4 + lymphocyt die at an acceler rate through uncontrol apoptosi , when stimul . , Treatment aim to inhibit apoptosi work to simultan inhibit the express of pro - apoptot factor and promot the express of anti - apoptot factor . Fa - induc apoptosi can be block by use of FLIP ( FLICE - inhibitori protein , which inhibit caspas - 8 and - 10 ), Bcl - 2 ( which prevent cytochrom c releas and the subsequ activ of caspas 9 ), and CrmA ( Cytokin respons modifi A ). Increas the concentr of IAP work to block specif caspas . Final , the Akt protein kinas promot cell surviv through two pathway . Akt phosphoryl and inhibit Ba ( a Bcl - 2 famili member ), caus Ba to interact with the 14 - 3 - 3 scaffold , result in Bcl dissoci and thu cell surviv . Akt also activ IKKα , which lead to NF - κB activ and cell surviv . Activ NF - κB induc the express of anti - apoptot gene such as Bcl - 2 , result in inhibit of apoptosi . , The progress of the human immunodefici viru infect into AID is primarili due to the deplet of CD4 + T - helper lymphocyt in a manner that is too rapid for the bodi ' s bone marrow to replenish the cell , lead to a compromis immun system . One of the mechan by which T - helper cell are deplet is apoptosi , which result from a seri of biochem pathway : [ 38 ] , Cell may also die as a direct consequ of viral infect . HIV - 1 express induc tubular cell G2 / M arrest and apoptosi . [ 39 ] The progress from HIV to AID is not immedi or even necessarili rapid HIV ' s cytotox activ toward CD4 + lymphocyt is classifi as AID onc a given patient ' s CD4 + cell count fall below 200 . [ 40 ] , Virus can trigger apoptosi of infect cell via a rang of mechan includ : , Most virus encod protein that can inhibit apoptosi . [ 42 ] Sever virus encod viral homolog of Bcl - 2 . These homolog can inhibit pro - apoptot protein such as BAX and BAK , which are essenti for the activ of apoptosi . Exampl of viral Bcl - 2 protein includ the Epstein - Barr viru BHRF1 protein and the adenoviru E1B 19K protein . [ 43 ] Some virus express caspas inhibitor that inhibit caspas activ and an exampl is the CrmA protein of cowpox virus . Whilst a number of virus can block the effect of TNF and Fa . For exampl the M - T2 protein of myxoma virus can bind TNF prevent it from bind the TNF receptor and induc a respons . [ 44 ] Furthermor , mani virus express p53 inhibitor that can bind p53 and inhibit it transcript transactiv activ . Consequ p53 cannot induc apoptosi sinc it cannot induc the express of pro - apoptot protein . The adenoviru E1B - 55K protein and the hepat B viru HBx protein are exampl of viral protein that can perform such a function . [ 45 ] , Interestingli , virus can remain intact from apoptosi particularli in the latter stage of infect . They can be export in the apoptot bodi that pinch off from the surfac of the die cell and the fact that they are engulf by phagocyt prevent the initi of a host respons . Thi favour the spread of the viru . [ 44 ] , Program cell death in plant ha a number of molecular similar to anim apoptosi , but it also ha differ , notabl the presenc of a cell wall and the lack of an immun system which remov the piec of the dead cell . Instead of an immun respons , the die cell synthes substanc to break itself down and place them in a vacuol which ruptur as the cell die . Whether thi whole process resembl anim apoptosi close enough to warrant use the name apoptosi ( as oppos to the more gener program cell death ) is unclear . [ 46 ] , There is an extrins pathway that ha been notic in sever toxic studi . It wa shown that an increas in calcium concentr within a cell , caus by drug activ , also ha the abil to caus apoptosi via a calcium - bind calpain proteas . , In 2003 , a method wa develop for predict subcellular locat of apoptosi protein [ 47 ] Subsequ , variou differ mode of Chou ' s pseudo amino acid composit were develop for improv the qualiti of predict subcellular local of apoptosi protein base on their sequenc inform alon .

"[ Tau protein are protein that stabil microtubul . They are abund in neuron of the central nervou system and are less common elsewher , but are also express at veri low level in CN astrocyt and oligodendrocyt [ 1 ] . When tau protein are defect , and no longer stabil microtubul properli , they can result in dementia such as Alzheim ' s diseas . , The tau protein are the product of altern splice from a singl gene that in human is design MAPT ( microtubul - associ protein tau ). [ 2 ] [ 3 ] They were discov in 1975 in Marc Kirschner ' s laboratori at Princeton Univers . [ 4 ] , Tau protein is a highli solubl microtubul - associ protein ( MAP ). In human , these protein are mostli found in neuron compar to non - neuron cell . One of tau ' s main function is to modul the stabil of axon microtubul . Other nervou system MAP may perform similar function , as suggest by tau knockout mice , who did not show abnorm in brain develop - possibl becaus of compens in tau defici by other MAP [ 5 ] . Tau is not present in dendrit and is activ primarili in the distal portion of axon where it provid microtubul stabil but also flexibl as need . Thi contrast with MAP6 ( STOP ) protein in the proxim portion of axon which essenti lock down the microtubul and MAP2 that stabil microtubul in dendrit . , Tau protein interact with tubulin to stabil microtubul and promot tubulin assembl into microtubul . Tau ha two way of control microtubul stabil : isoform and phosphoryl . , Six tau isoform exist in human brain tissu , and they are distinguish by their number of bind domain . Three isoform have three bind domain and the other three have four bind domain . The bind domain are locat in the carboxi - terminu of the protein and are posit - charg ( allow it to bind to the neg - charg microtubul ). The isoform with four bind domain are better at stabil microtubul than those with three bind domain . The isoform are a result of altern splice in exon 2 , 3 , and 10 of the tau gene . , Tau is a phosphoprotein with 79 potenti Serin ( Ser ) and Threonin ( Thr ) phosphoryl site on the longest tau isoform . Phosphoryl ha been report on approxim 30 of these site in normal tau protein . [ 6 ] , Phosphoryl of tau is regul by a host of kinas , includ PKN , a serin / threonin kinas . When PKN is activ , it phosphoryl tau , result in disrupt of microtubul organ . [ 7 ] , Phosphoryl of tau is also development regul . For exampl , fetal tau is more highli phosphoryl in the embryon CN than adult tau . [ 8 ] The degre of phosphoryl in all six isoform decreas with age due to the activ of phosphatas . [ 9 ] Like kinas , phosphatas too play a role in regul the phosphoryl of tau . For exampl , PP2A and PP2B are both present in human brain tissu and have the abil to dephosphoryl Ser396 . [ 10 ] The bind of these phosphatas to tau affect tau ' s associ with MT . , The MAPT gene for encod tau protein is locat on chromosom 17q 21 , contain 16 exon . The major tau protein in the human brain is encod by 11 exon . Exon 2 , 3 and 10 are altern splice , allow six combin ( 2 – 3 – 10 – 2 + 3 – 10 – 2 + 3 + 10 – 2 – 3 – 10 + 2 + 3 – 10 + 2 + 3 + 10 + ). Thu , in the human brain , the tau protein constitut a famili of six isoform with the rang from 352 - 441 amino acid . They differ in either zero , one or two insert of 29 amino acid at the N - termin part ( exon 2 and 3 ), and three or four repeat - region at the C - termin part exon 10 miss . So , the longest isoform in the CN ha four repeat ( R1 , R2 , R3 and R4 ) and two insert ( 441 amino acid total ), while the shortest isoform ha three repeat ( R1 , R3 and R4 ) and no insert ( 352 amino acid total ). , The MAPT gene ha two haplogroup , H1 and H2 , in which the gene appear in invert orient . Haplogroup H2 is common onli in Europ and in peopl with European ancestri . Haplogroup H1 appear to be associ with increas probabl of certain dementia , such as Alzheim ' s diseas . The presenc of both haplogroup in Europ mean that recombin between invert haplotyp can result in the lack of one of the function copi of the gene , result in congenit defect . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] , Hyperphosphoryl of the tau protein ( tau inclus , pTau ) can result in the self - assembl of tangl of pair helic filament and straight filament , which are involv in the pathogenesi of Alzheim ' s diseas and other tauopathi . [ 15 ] , All of the six tau isoform are present in an often hyperphosphoryl state in pair helic filament from Alzheim ' s diseas brain . In other neurodegen diseas , the deposit of aggreg enrich in certain tau isoform ha been report . When misfold , thi otherwis veri solubl protein can form extrem insolubl aggreg that contribut to a number of neurodegen diseas . , Tau protein ha been shown to interact with FYN , [ 16 ] Alpha - synuclein , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] YWHAZ [ 19 ] and S100B .

It shape is fusiform and later compress , with it mouth direct upward . Male are torpedo - shape and have gold stripe between the blue stripe femal have a larger , whitish belli and have silver stripe instead of gold . Adult femal will exhibit a small genit papilla in front of the anal fin origin . The zebrafish can grow to 6 . 4 centimetr ( 2 . 5 &# 160in ), although it is uncommon for them to grow past 4 &# 160cm in captiv . Life - span in captiv is around 2 – 3 year , although in ideal condit , may extend to 5 year . [ 4 ] , The approxim gener time for the Danio is 3 – 4 month . A male must be present for ovul and spawn to occur . Femal are abl to spawn at interv of 2 – 3 day , lay hundr of egg in each clutch .

The most commonli found WT strain are : AB , TÜ , IN and WIK . , AB ( AB ) AB / C32 ( AB / C32 ) AB / TL ( AB / TL ) AB / Tuebingen ( AB / TU ) C32 ( C32 ) Cologn ( KOLN ) Darjeel ( DAR ) Ekkwil ( EKW ) , HK / AB ( HK / AB ) HK / Sing ( HK / SING ) Hong Kong ( HK ) India ( IND ) Indonesia ( INDO ) Nadia ( NA ) RIKEN WT ( RW ) Singapor ( SING ) , SJA ( SJA ) SJD ( SJD ) SJD / C32 ( SJD / C32 ) Tuebingen ( TU ) Tupfel long fin ( TL ) Tupfel long fin nacr ( TLN ) WIK ( WIK ) WIK / AB ( WIK / AB ) , Hybrid between differ Danio speci may be fertil : for exampl , between D . rerio and D . nigrofasciatu . [ 8 ] , See link for photo of hybrid : Figur 1 . Danio pigment pattern divers and phenotyp of D . rerio hybrid with other danio . , Zebrafish are hardi fish and consid good for beginn aquarist . Their eas of keep and breed , beauti , price , play natur and broad avail all contribut to their popular . They thrive best in 22 – 28 ° C ( 72 – 82 &# 160 ° F ) water . They need an aquarium of 10 US gallon ( 38 &# 160L ) or more , and they do well in school . They also thrive as shoal of six or more , and interact well with other fish type in the aquarium . Howev , they are suscept to Oodinium or velvet diseas , microsporidia ( Pseudoloma neurophilia ), and Mycobacterium speci . Given the opportun , adult eat hatchl , which may be protect by separ the two group with a net , breed box or separ tank . , D . rerio is a common and use model organ for studi of vertebr develop and gene function . [ 2 ] Georg Streising at the Univers of Oregon establish it util . Success with it in larg scale forward genet screen ( commonli refer to as the Tübingen / Boston screen ) consolid it import . The scholarli journal Develop [ 9 ] devot an issu [ 10 ] to research use it in celebr of thi landmark . It ha a dedic onlin databas of genet , genom , and development inform , the Zebrafish Inform Network ( ZFIN ). D . rerio is one of the few fish speci to have reach space . They may supplement higher vertebr model , such as rat and mice . , Research with D . rerio ha allow advanc in the field of development biolog , oncolog , [ 12 ] toxicolog , [ 13 ] reproduct studi , teratolog , genet , neurobiolog , environment scienc , stem cell and regen medicin , [ 14 ] and evolutionari theori . [ 8 ] , It greatest advantag for use as a model system includ : , Other advantag : , Zebrafish have the abil to regener fin , skin , the heart [ 17 ] and the brain ( in larval stage ). Heart muscl regener doe not make use of stem cell instead , matur heart muscl cell regress to a stem - cell - like state and redifferenti . [ 17 ] In 2011 the British Heart Foundat ran an advertis ( includ on televis and onlin ) campaign publicis their intent to studi the applic of thi abil to human by " spend [ ing ] £ 50 million on a programm of groundbreak research that could help us begin to repair damag [ human ] heart ." [ 18 ] , Zebrafish have also been found to regener photoreceptor cell and retin neuron follow injuri . The mechan of thi regener are unknown . Research frequent amput the dorsal and ventral tail fin and analyz their regrowth to test for mutat . Thi research is lead the scientif commun in the understand of heal / repair mechan in vertebr . It ha also been found if the same fin is damag enough time , the fish will grow a new fin which will have mutat onli a small amount . Most scientist believ thi is a defenc mechan to tri to prevent the fin from be damag again . [ citat need ] , A common revers genet techniqu is to reduc gene express or modifi splice use Morpholino antisens technolog . Morpholino oligonucleotid ( MO ) are stabl , synthet macromolecul that contain the same base as DNA or RNA by bind to complementari RNA sequenc , they reduc the express of specif gene . The journal Genesi [ 19 ] devot an issu [ 20 ] to research use MO , mostli in D . rerio . MO can be inject into one cell of an embryo after the 32 - cell stage , reduc gene express in onli cell descend from that cell . Howev , cell in the earli embryo ( less than 32 cell ) are interperm to larg molecul , [ 21 ] [ 22 ] allow diffus between cell . A known problem with gene knockdown is that , becaus the genom underw a duplic after the diverg of ray - fin fish and lobe - fin fish , it is not alway easi to silenc the activ one of the two gene paralog reliabl due to complement by the other paralog . , Despit the complic of the zebrafish genom , a number of commerci avail global platform for analysi of both gene express by microarray and promot regul use ChIP - on - chip exist . , In 2009 , research at the Institut of Genom and Integr Biolog , Delhi announc the sequenc of a wild caught strain , contain 1 . 7 billion genet letter . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] , In Octob 2001 , research from the Univers of Oklahoma publish D . rerio ' s complet mitochondri DNA sequenc . [ 25 ] It length is 16 , 596 base pair . Thi is within 100 base pair of other relat speci of fish , and it is notabl onli 18 pair longer than the goldfish ( Carassiu auratu ) and 21 longer than the carp ( Cyprinu carpio ). It gene order and content is ident to the common vertebr form of mitochondri DNA . It contain 13 protein - code gene and a noncod control region contain the origin of replic for the heavi strand . In between a group of five tRNA gene , a sequenc resembl vertebr origin of light strand replic is found . It is difficult to draw evolutionari conclus becaus it is difficult to determin whether base pair chang have adapt signific via comparison with other vertebr nucleotid sequenc . , In Decemb 2005 , a studi of the golden strain identifi the gene respons for it unusu pigment as SLC24A5 , a solut carrier that appear to be requir for melanin product , and confirm it function with a Morpholino knockdown . The ortholog gene wa then character in human and a one base pair differ wa found to strongli segreg fair - skin European and dark - skin African . [ 26 ] , Transgenesi is a popular approach to studi the function of gene in zebrafish . Construct of transgen zebrafish is rather easi by a method use the Tol2 transposon system . [ 27 ] , In Januari 2007 , Chines research at Fudan Univers genet modifi fish to detect oestrogen pollut in lake and river , which is link to male infertil . [ 28 ] , In cardiovascular research the zebrafish is be use to model blood clot , blood vessel develop , heart failur , and congenit heart diseas . In programm of research into acut inflamm , a major underpin process in mani diseas , research have establish a zebrafish model of inflamm , and it resolut . An approach that allow detail studi of the genet control of inflamm and the possibl of identifi potenti new drug . , Anoth focu of work is to understand how a gene call Hedgehog , a biolog signal that underli a number of human cancer , control cell growth . Thi is fast becom an avenu of research that is lead to new cancer therapi . In probe disord of the nervou system , includ neurodegen diseas , movement disord , psychiatr disord and deaf , research are use the zebrafish to understand how the genet defect underli these condit caus function abnorm in the human brain , spinal cord and sensori organ . Research are delv into the complex of muscl degener in genet model of human musculoskelet diseas , such as muscular dystrophi . , These studi exemplifi how zebrafish research offer uniqu opportun to understand some of the greatest challeng in medic scienc , by enabl new discoveri of how cell and tissu work to be translat into new way of understand a broad rang of human diseas . , Final , and as demonstr through ongo research programm , the zebrafish model afford an ideal opportun , not onli to identifi novel candid for gene underli human diseas , but offer a potenti system in which to begin to develop novel therapeut agent in drug discoveri programm , henc help to identifi new treatment . [ 29 ] , In 2007 , research at Univers Colleg London grew a type of zebrafish adult stem cell found in the eye of fish and mammal that develop into neuron in the retina — the part of the eye that send messag to the brain . These cell could be inject in the eye to treat diseas that damag retin neuron — nearli everi diseas of the eye , includ macular degener , glaucoma , and diabet - relat blind . Retin damag is respons for most case of sight loss . The research studi Müller glial cell in the eye of human age from 18 month to 91 year and were abl to develop them into all type of retin neuron . They were abl to grow them easili in the lab . The stem cell success migrat into diseas rat ' retina and took on the characterist of the surround neuron . The team is work on the same approach in human . [ 30 ] , In 2008 , research at Children ' s Hospit Boston develop a new strain of zebrafish , name Casper , whose adult bodi were transpar . [ 31 ] Thi allow for detail visual of cellular activ , circul , metastasi and mani other phenomena . Becaus mani gene function are share between fish and human , Casper is expect to yield insight into human diseas such as leukemia and other cancer .
