"Domain structure of tau isoforms and constructs. Tau40 is the longest tau isoform in the human CNS, occurring mostly in axons (Goedert et al., 1989). It consists of 441 amino acid residues and can be divided into an NH2-terminal projection domain and a COOH-terminal microtubule binding domain containing four imperfect repeats (R1√êR4) and basic proline-rich sequences on either side that act as microtubule targeting domains (shaded dark, P1, and P2). The repeats show high homology between tau, MAP2, and MAP4. The shaded NH2-terminal inserts and repeat two can be alternatively spliced, resulting in six different tau isoforms. The predominantly embryonic isoform tau23 lacks all three inserts (352 residues). Tau constructs K12 and K10 are derived from tau23, they contain three repeats plus either a COOHterminal flanking region (K12) or the whole COOH-terminal tail (K10).

"Effects of different tau constructs on mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells. Mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells stably transfected with different tau constructs was examined after paraformaldehyde fixation. This allows the visualization of total tau in the cells, but tends to dissociate tau from the microtubules (see Materials and Methods). Human tau23, the shortest tau-isoform (a and b), as well as K35 (c and d), a tau construct lacking nearly the entire projection domain (see Fig. 1) both led to the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering near the MTOC as seen in tau40-stable cells. On the other hand, K23 (e and f), a tau construct lacking the microtubule-binding region and K12 (g and h), consisting mainly of this MT-binding region (Fig. 1), did not alter the distribution of mitochondria. This argues for a tight binding of tau to microtubules as a prerequisite for impairment of plus-end√êdirected transport of these organelles and excludes the possibility that tau might inhibit kinesin by directly interacting with the motor protein. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker¬™ Red (a, c, e, and g) and transfected tau with polyclonal anti√êtau antibody K9JA (b, d, f, and h).

"A coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, at the level on which the entorhinal cortex was measured. The area outlined represents the portion of the scan used to orient the operator to the landmarks of the entorhinal cortex. A box has been placed over the region of interest in one hemisphere. (b) A diagram of the entorhinal cortex (ent) and adjoining medial temporal
lobe regions, including the rhinal sulcus (rs), the hippocampus (H), the amygdala (A), the subiculum (S), and the mammillary bodies (mb). (c) The region of the entorhinal cortex measured in the present study, as delineated on the MRI scan of a control subject.
The entorhinal cortex is located inframedially on the surface of the brain. It is fused with the subiculum of the hippocampus medially and extends to the rhinal sulcus laterally. The entorhinal cortex was outlined on three consecutive normalized coronal images centered at the level of the mammillary bodies. The outline of the region began at the angle formed by the junction of the rhinal sulcus and the surface of the brain (the posterior end of this region may be continuous with the collateral sulcus in some subjects). The outline then transected this angle, cutting across the gray matter to the level of the white matter. Then the edge of the white matter was followed to the inferior surface of the hippocampus. The outline then followed the surface of the brain back to the starting point. (This protocol was based on the fact that the most anterior and posterior edges of entorhinal cortex and the banks of the superior temporal sulcus are difficult to define with reliability. Moreover, unbiased stereological data from human brain tissue indicate that the neuron counts within a single section of these brain regions are excellent predictors of total volume.17,18)";"0.19742";"melorheostosis";"An osteosclerosis that has_material_basis_in a mutation of the LEMD3 gene which results_in a hyperdense bony cortex.";"0.194807";"adrenal cortical adenocarcinoma";"An adrenal carcinoma that originating in the cortex of the adrenal gland.";"0.1833";"adrenal carcinoma";"An adrenal cancer that is located_in the cortex (steroid hormone-producing tissue) of the adrenal gland.";"0.169538";"viral encephalitis";"An encephalitis that involves inflammation of the brain caused by viral infection.";"0.16582";"Cushing syndrome";"Cushing syndrome is a endocrine syndrome caused by overactivity of the adrenal cortex caused by a tumor of the pituitary gland.";"0.163223";"Herpes simplex virus meningoencephalitis";"A Simplexvirus infectious disease that results_in inflammation located_in brain and located_in meninges, has_material_basis_in Human herpesvirus 2 and has_symptom headache, has_symptom lesions in the brain, and has_symptom cerebral hemorrhage.";"0.158338";"cerebral amebiasis";"An amebiasis that involves infection of the brain caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica resulting in brain abscesses.";"0.148055";"cerebral actinomycosis";"An actinomycosis that involves invasion and infiltration located_in brain, has_material_basis_in Actinomyces israelii.

"(a) A sagittal reconstruction of a coronally acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, at the level on which the cingulate gyrus was measured. The area outlined represents the portion of the scan used to orient the operator to the landmarks of the cingulate. A box has been placed over the region of interest in one hemisphere. (b) A diagram of the cingulate gyrus divided into the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC), the caudal portion of the interior cingulate (CAC), and the posterior cingulate (PC). Adjoining landmarks include the corpus callosum (CC), the lateral ventricle (Lat. Vent.), and the thalamus (Thal.). (c) The region of the cingulate gyrus measured in the present study, as delineated on the MRI scan of a control subject. The cingulate gyrus was measured on consecutive normalized coronal slices from the rostral most extent to the marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus. First, the sagittal view was used to demarcate the cingulate sulcus in each hemisphere. This information was then transferred to the coronal image. Second, the cingulate gyrus was outlined; this began at the lateral most point of the corpus callosum sulcus, continued along the surface of the callosum medially to the interhemispheric fissure, then dorsally to the cingulate sulcus, and then laterally to the lateral most extent of the cingulate sulcus; to surround the portion of the cingulate gyrus to be measured, a straight line was then drawn connecting the lateral most extent of the cingulate and the corpus callosum sulci. Third, the outlined region was then divided into three sections by two lines: the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC) was identified by drawing a line in the coronal plane at the tip of the corpus callosum, and the caudal portion of the anterior cingulate (CAC) was differentiated from the posterior cingulate (PC) by drawing a line through the cingulate gyrus in the coronal plane at the level of the mammillary bodies (white matter tracts representing the end of the fornix are used to mark the middle of the mamillary bodies in this plane).";"0.235997";"acrocallosal syndrome";"A syndrome that is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterized by corpus callosum agenesis, polydactyly, multiple dysmorphic features, motor and mental retardation.";"0.169059";"uterus leiomyosarcoma";"A uterine Corpus sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma and uterine Corpus smooth muscle neoplasm that is located_in the smooth muscle of the uterus.";"0.158566";"recurrent uterine sarcoma";"A uterine Corpus sarcoma that has recurred after it has been treated.";"0.151531";"focal labyrinthitis";"A labyrinthitis which is an infectious inflammatory disease of a circumscribed area of either the vestibular or the cochlear portion of the labyrinth, or of both together.
