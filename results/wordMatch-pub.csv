"(a) A sagittal reconstruction of a coronally acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, at the level on which the cingulate gyrus was measured. The area outlined represents the portion of the scan used to orient the operator to the landmarks of the cingulate. A box has been placed over the region of interest in one hemisphere. (b) A diagram of the cingulate gyrus divided into the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC), the caudal portion of the interior cingulate (CAC), and the posterior cingulate (PC). Adjoining landmarks include the corpus callosum (CC), the lateral ventricle (Lat. Vent.), and the thalamus (Thal.). (c) The region of the cingulate gyrus measured in the present study, as delineated on the MRI scan of a control subject. The cingulate gyrus was measured on consecutive normalized coronal slices from the rostral most extent to the marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus. First, the sagittal view was used to demarcate the cingulate sulcus in each hemisphere. This information was then transferred to the coronal image. Second, the cingulate gyrus was outlined; this began at the lateral most point of the corpus callosum sulcus, continued along the surface of the callosum medially to the interhemispheric fissure, then dorsally to the cingulate sulcus, and then laterally to the lateral most extent of the cingulate sulcus; to surround the portion of the cingulate gyrus to be measured, a straight line was then drawn connecting the lateral most extent of the cingulate and the corpus callosum sulci. Third, the outlined region was then divided into three sections by two lines: the rostral portion of the anterior cingulate (RAC) was identified by drawing a line in the coronal plane at the tip of the corpus callosum, and the caudal portion of the anterior cingulate (CAC) was differentiated
from the posterior cingulate (PC) by drawing a line through the cingulate gyrus in the coronal plane at the level of the mammillary bodies (white matter tracts representing the end of the fornix are used to mark the middle of the mamillary bodies in this plane).";"125";"acquired, and, and, and, and, and, study, anterior, anterior, anterior, are, area, as, at, at, at, at, be, thalamus, scan, scan, scan, corpus callosum, corpus callosum, corpus callosum, corpus callosum, lateral ventricle, box, white matter, caudal, caudal, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, region, region, region, consecutive, information, magnetic resonance imaging, control, coronal plane, coronal plane, image, diagram, each, end, white, extent, extent, extent, first, fissure, from, from, surface, view, include, interest, into, into, subject, lateral, lateral, lateral, lateral, level, level, line, line, line, operator, marginal, mark, measured, measured, measured, measured, middle, plane, plane, plane, most, most, most, most, one, operator, over, point, posterior, posterior, present, rostral, rostral, rostral, second, second, second, then, then, then, then, then, third, third, three, tip, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, two, white";"66";"acquired, and, study, anterior, are, area, as, at, be, thalamus, scan, corpus callosum, lateral ventricle, box, white matter, caudal, cingulate gyrus, region, consecutive, information, magnetic resonance imaging, control, coronal plane, image, diagram, each, end, white, extent, first, fissure, from, surface, view, include, interest, into, subject, lateral, level, line, operator, marginal, mark, measured, middle, plane, most, one, operator, over, point, posterior, present, rostral, second, second, second, then, third, third, three, tip, to, two, white"
"Transferrin recycling is retarded by tau overexpression.
Cells were seeded on cover slips and preincubated with
TMR-labeled transferrin in serum-free medium for 2 h. Excess
transferrin was removed and tau-stable and mock-transfected

"Effects of different tau constructs on mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells. Mitochondrial distribution in CHO cells stably transfected with different tau constructs was examined after paraformaldehyde fixation. This allows the visualization of total tau in the cells, but tends to dissociate tau from the microtubules (see Materials and Methods). Human tau23, the shortest tau-isoform (a and b), as well as K35 (c and d), a tau construct lacking nearly the entire projection domain (see Fig. 1) both led to the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering near the MTOC as seen in tau40-stable cells. On the other hand, K23 (e and f), a tau construct lacking the microtubule-binding region and K12 (g and h), consisting mainly of this MT-binding region (Fig. 1), did not alter the distribution of mitochondria. This argues for a tight binding of tau to microtubules as a prerequisite for impairment of plus-endÃdirected transport of these organelles and excludes the possibility that tau might inhibit kinesin by directly interacting with the motor protein.

"Fig. 1. Intracellular injection of htau-expressing plasmids induces the accumulation of dense deposits of filamentous tau in ABCs that resemble
those seen in human neurofibrillary degenerative disease. (A) Htau constructs used in this study. The shortest 3 MT binding repeat form of htau
(Tau-23) was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) either fused to the amino terminus (clone #93) or expressed separately
(clone #82). Both produced bright fluorescence when examined 4-8 days after intracellular injection of the parent plasmid (pEGFP) into ABCs and
caused filamentous htau deposits to accumulate in ABC somata and dendrites. (B) Dorsal view of the living hindbrain showing 4 ABCs expressing
htau-23 74 days after injection. The brain is viewed in a combination of fluorescence and bright field illumination under a dissecting microscope,
and has just been trimmed prior to fixation (arrow). Photos similar to this were used to identifiy htau-expressing ABCs for conventional EM
analysis under hard fixed conditions by spatial criterial alone (see Materials and Methods). Asterisk marks soma of non-expressing ABC, caret
denotes axon of rostralmost expressing cell. (C) Transverse section through the soma and axon (caret) of an ABC with a condensed htau deposit
resembling an AD neurofibrillary tangle. The section is immunolabelled with the mAb PHF-1, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope on htau
at serines 396-404. Arrow indicates the approximate region shown in D. (D) Electron micrograph of a condensed deposit of htau filaments in the
soma of an ABC 74 days after plasmid injection (approximately 70 days of expression). The field shown is near the base of the main lateral
dendrite, with the periphery of the cell at left, while the center of the cell (which contains a large tangle-like htau deposit similar to that shown in C)
extends to the top and right of the micrograph. Note that htau filaments form a dense meshwork of 6-15 nm filaments that either trap membranous
organelles (mainly mitochondria) or confine them to the periphery of the cells, where they form aggregations (asterisks). Arrows in inset denote an
MT (large arrow) and htau filaments (carets). (E) The soma of another ABC that had been expressing EGFP alone (pEGFP-c2, Clontech) for 30
days. Note the absence of filamentous deposits, the evenly distributed mitochondria (asterisks), and the presence of normal cellular components
such as MTs (arrow) and Golgi. Bars: B, 100 mm; C, 25 mm; D-E, 1 mm; D inset, 200 nm.

Fig. 2. Htau filaments are immunocytotchemically distinguishable and morphologically distinct from neurofilaments in ABCs expressing htau-23.
(A) Adjacent transverse sections through an ABC expressing clone #93. Note that immunolabel for phosphorylated htau23 (PHF-1) is found
throughout the cell (top left) including the distal dendrites (arrows), but that immunolabel for lamprey neurofilaments protein (NF-180) is
concentrated in the soma (right), with only light labelling in the dendritic field. Bottom panel shows higher magnification of inset region (right)
showing the lack of anti-NF-180 immunolabel in proximal dendrites (arrows). (B) Double immunolabelling of ABC dendrites after 5 days of htau
expression (clone #93). Large (10 nm) colloidal gold particles mark anti-NF immunolabelling with the mAb LCM3, small (5 nm) particles mark
anti-GFP immunolabel. Note that large particles (arrows) and small particles (carets) do not colocalize and label separate filaments. (C) Electron
micrographs of htau filaments (top) and NFs (bottom) made at high magnification. Both fields shown contained a MT profile (shown at center),
which was adjusted so that both MTs were shown at the same diameter (carets), thereby providing an internal control. Tau filaments are readily
distinguishable from NFs by their somewhat larger diameters (11.7 nm vs 8.9 nm), their lack of sidearms (shown by arrows), their lack of the
relatively constant spacing from one another characteristic of NFs, and their less wavy appearance. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200 nm; C, 100 nm.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the effects of resulting from NF-180 (A-B,E) and htau23 (C-D,F) overexpression in ABC dendrites. (A,C) Transverse 6 mm 
sections through ABCs expressing NF-180 (A) and htau-23 (C) at approximately 25 days of expression. Note that immunostaining for exogenous
NF-180 is evenly distributed throughout the soma and dendrites, while htau is found in localized heavy deposits, especially in the soma and
proximal dendrites (C, arrow). Note also that the dendrites are grossly disrupted by htau overexpression, where distal dendrites exhibit a characteristic
‘beaded’ appearance (C, carets), but appear normal with NF-180 overexpression. Proximal dendrites show no obvious changes in gross morphology
with either htau or NF-180 overexpression (arrows, A,C), at least at early times of expression. (B,D) Electron micrographs of hard fixed (3.5% glutaraldehyde)
preparations ABC proximal dendrites at 25 and 50 days of expression of NF-180 (B) and htau-23 (D), respectively. Both htau filaments and NFs are
deposited throughout the dendrites, where they form a fine meshwork of filaments. However, NF-180 overexpression does not induce mitochondrial
aggregation, while htau23 overexpression does (D, asterisks). (E,F) NFs accumulate as discrete, usually parallel bundles of relatively tightly 
packed, but evenly spaced filaments with sidearms in ABC dendrites (E, inset 1, arrow). NF bundles exclude other cytoplasmic elements and are
aligned with MTs along the longitudinal axis of the dendrite(E, arrows), and neither MTs nor impinging synapses (s) are not reduced in number. 
By contrast, MTs and synapses are rarer in the dendrites of htau-expressing ABCs than in normal dendrites from non-expressing cells (F), and 
tau filaments form bundles in which filaments frequently cross each other (F inset 2). Bars: A,C, 25 mm; B,D, 500 nm; E,F, 200 nm.

Fig. 4. Effects of htau23 overexpression on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of ABC distal dendrites (A) Secondary and tertiary
dendrites from an ABC injected with Lucifer Yellow shows the smooth, tapered profiles typical of normal ABC dendrites. (B) Distal dendrites
of ABCs expressing htau23 show characteristic ‘beaded’ morphology, with the heaviest anti-tau immunolabel localized to the region near the
plasma membrane and sometimes a core of immunolabel near the center of the dendrite (arrows). (C-D) Effects of htau23 overexpression on
ABC dendritic ultrastructure is shown in photomontages of dendrites from normal (C) and htau expressing (D) ABCs. Dendritic profiles are
shown by outlines. Normal ABC dendrites have a cytoskeleton consisting of evenly spaced MTs (inset 1) which is disrupted and lost in the
vicinity of dendritic beads (inset 2), while fascicles consisting of tau filaments and a few MTs remain in the center of beads (inset 2, arrow) and
in the constricted regions between beads (inset 3). Note the similarity between this pattern and the beaded dendrites shown in LM preparations
(B, also see Fig. 6A) Large, electron dense multivesicular bodies resembling secondary lysosomes are found in most beads (D, carets). Some
synapses (s) are still present on beaded distal dendrites of htau23-expressing ABCs, and are sometime still present even where the cytoskeleton
has already disappeared (inset 3). Bars: A,B, 10 mm; C,D, 5 mm; insets 1,2, 1 mm; inset 3, 1 mm.

Fig. 5. Ultrastructural changes associated with dendritic beading in ABCs at 10 days of expression Examples of beaded dendrites from ABCs at
10 days of htau23 expression illustrate the range of degenerative changes associated with htau overexpression in ABC distal dendrites.
Dendrites shown range from relatively mildly affected cases (A) to dendrites showing severe degeneration (D). High magnifications of the
regions shown as insets in each of the micrographs at left are shown at right. (A) A dendrite in which few if any tau filaments are present and
the number of MTs is nearly normal, especially in less distended regions of the dendrite (inset, arrows). Expansions in this dendrite are
associated with membranous material (inset asterisks). (B and C) Dendrites in an intermediate stage of degeneration, where constricted parts of
the dendrite show a cytoskeleton consisting of both tau filaments (insets, carets) and MTs, while distended regions have lost their cytoskeletal
elements. Finally, in D, there are hardly any cytoskeletal elements left except for bundles of tau filaments (inset, caret) in constricted regions of
the dendrite. Distension appears to be associated in all cases with the presence of membranous material, which preferentially associates with
tau filaments (D, inset, arrow). Synapses (asterisks in left panels) are relatively unaffected, except that they sometimes lose their postsynaptic
densities (D, inset, ‘s’). Note that in all of these dendrites the plasma membrane is still well defined, suggesting that plasma membrane
degeneration occurs later than cytoskeletal loss (see Fig. 6). Bars: left panels, 500 nm; insets, 100 nm.

Fig. 6. ABC dendrites fill with htau filaments and show plasma membrane degeneration after long periods of htau expression. (A) Light micrograph 
of an ABC expressing EGFP-tagged tau-23 (clone #93) at 45 days of expression immunostained with PHF-1. This cell shows dendrites in different stages of
degeneration, with some still having well defined profiles (caret), while others show poorly defined, membranous staining. Note the loss of membrane
integrity and filamentous htau deposits in peridendritic regions of the soma (asterisk) and the beading of more distal dendrites (arrow). (B) Electron micrograph
of a dendrite from an ABC expressing a different tau-23 clone (#82) in which EGFP and tau-23 are expressed separately. Note that the dendrite is filled
with abnormal htau filaments ranging between 10 and 18 nm in diameter, while immunolabel for GFP (10 nm gold particles) is very light. Most of these
filaments appear to be cylindrical (inset, caret), resembling AD ‘straight’ filaments, while some appear to have a more ribbonlike morphology (inset, arrow). Note
that this dendrite contains relatively few MTs, although the plasma membrane is still well defined. White asterisk (inset) marks immunogold particle showing scale. 
(C) Higher magnification of a dendrite similar to that in B from an ABC expressing clone #93 (70 days of expression). Heavy immunolabelling of htau
filaments with anti-GFP can be seen, as can a clearly defined plasma membrane. Note that while most htau filaments exhibit the same ‘straight’
structure shown in B and D (C, arrow), a few show periodic expansions suggestive of a twisted structure (C, carets). (D) Dendrite from an ABC
in a hard-fixed brain after 75 days of htau-23 expression showing htau filaments, MT loss and degenerative changes in the plasma membrane.
Membranous organelles that had accumulated in the dendrites are degenerating (black asterisks) as are some synapses (white asterisk). The
cytoskeleton of the dendrite consists of a tangled skein of 10-15 nm htau filaments interspersed with occasional short MTs (inset, caret), in a
pattern similar to that shown in B and C. Note the absence of very thin filaments and the ‘meshlike’ pattern. seen at earlier times post plasmid
injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. 7). Tau filaments have no sidearms (inset, arrow) and are frequently interlaced in a skeinlike pattern that contrasts
sharply with the well organized MTs in an adjacent normal dendrite (arrows). Note also that the plasma membrane of the htau-expressing
dendrite is very poorly defined compared to that of the normal dendrite, and appears to be degenerating. (E) Dendrite from a brain prepared for
immunoEM after 70 days of htau expression (clone #93) and immunostained for GFP similar to that shown in C. MTs are very rare or absent.
Approximately 95% of the immunolabel localizes to bundles of htau filaments in dendrites; much of the other 5% labels what appear to be
filamentous structures outside of the dendrite (arrows); again note the very poor definition of the plasma membrane. Bars: A, 25 mm; B, 200
nm; A inset 50 nm; C, 100 nm; D, 50 mm; E, 2000 nm.

Fig. 7. Some htau filaments immunolabel with a tubulin in ABC dendrites. (A) Immunolabeling pattern of the anti-acetylated a tubulin (mAb 6- 11b) in 
a dendrite with abundant MTs from an ABC after 5 days of htau expression. Note that while acetylated tubulin immunostaining is highly specific to polymerized
tubulin in MTs, some specific staining for htau filaments can also be found, especially on filaments that are close to MTs (carets). (B) Anti-a tubulin mAb DM1A
immunostaining of a dendrite from another htau-expressing ABC from the same brain as A. DM1A, which recognizes all a tubulin, is much less specific to MTs than 6-
11b, with much of the immunolabel colocalizing with 4- 15 nm filaments rather than MTs (arrows). The lack of general background label suggests that this
is specific labelling of dimeric or oligomeric tubulin that has been absorbed onto htau filaments. (C) Another dendrite from the same cell immunolabelled with 6-11b 
showing a region in which MTs predominate (far right of the micrograph) compared to an adjacent region where tau filaments form most of the cytoskeleton (center and left). 
Note that (D) A similar dendrite from a ‘hard fixed’ preparation is shown at the same scale as A-C to better illustrate MT and tau filament morphology.

"Since AD is associated with a decrease in memory function and the hippocampus might play a role in memory function, researchers focussed on the degeneration of the hippocampus. Bilateral hippocamal atrophy is found in the brains of Alzheimer patients9. Reduction of the hippocampus for diagnosing is measured in two different ways. By using volumetry of the hippocampus itself or by using volumetry of the AHC (amygdale hippocampal complex).
Volumetric studies of the hippocampus showed a reduction of 25 -39% 10,11,12. When measuring relative size in relation to the total cranial volume even a bigger reduction is found of 45%10. Yearly measurements of hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer patients showed a 3.98 /-1.92% decrease per year (p < 0.001)6. Patients with severe AD disease show higher atrophy rates compared to early or mild AD10,11. 
Correlations are found between hippocampal atrophy and severity of dementia, age 11and sex. Because a correlation is found between age and hippocampal atrophy, volumetric changes should be correct for age and sex. 

For clinical diagnoses it still remains uncertain whether volumetric measurements of the hippocampus alone is the most accurate way, some studies imply so 12. For diagnosing AD by hippocampal volume measurements the sensitivity varies between 77% and 95% and a specificity of 71-92% 9, 11-14. 

The sensitivity and specificity varies due the variance of patients and controls used. Patients varies in severity of disease and controls in these studies included FTP, MCI or non-alzheimer elderly. 

Other studies found that diagnosis based on volumetric changes are comparable for the hippocampus and ERC, but due the more easier use and less variability of hippocampal volumetry, the hippocampus is more feasible for diagnosis 13, 15.  Other studies found that combinations of different volumetric measurements with parahippocampal cortex, ERC14or amygdale (see AHC)  are indeed needed for a more accurate diagnosis of AD patients. AD has some similar atrophic regions compared to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), therefore volumetry of the ERC in combination with hippocampal volumetry can give a more accurate diagnosis of AD 14.


Total intracranial volume (TIV) and temporal horn indices (THI:  ratio of THV to lateral ventricular volume) can be used as surrogate marker for volume loss of hippocampal formation. A negative correlation is found between THI and THV and the declarative reminding test 16.

Some studies indicate that the accuracy of AD diagnosis increases by volumetry of amygdala-hippocampal complex (AHC) compared to only volumetric measurements of the hippocampus 10";"153";"disease, disease, dementia, accuracy, age, age, age, atrophy, atrophy, atrophy, atrophy, dementia, amygdala, relative, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, are, are, are, as, associated, degeneration, be, be, between, between, between, between, bilateral, can, can, diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis, clinical, severity, severity, cognitive, combination, complex, complex, complex, complex, variability, correct, correlation, correlation, cranial, volume, volume, volume, volume, volume, ratio, due, due, early, elderly, sex, sex, size, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, formation, function, function, give, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, hippocampus, impairment, intracranial, lateral, loss, measured, memory, memory, mild, mild, most, negative, or, or, or, other, other, per, per year, volume, volume, volume, volume, volume, role, see, sensitivity, sensitivity, severe, sensitivity, sensitivity, since, some, some, some, temporal, test, to, to, to, to, to, total, total, two, uncertain, use, use, variance, ventricular, when, with, with, with, with, year, memory, memory";"75";"disease, dementia, accuracy, age, atrophy, dementia, amygdala, relative, and, are, as, associated, degeneration, be, between, bilateral, can, diagnosis, clinical, severity, cognitive, combination, complex, complex, variability, correct, correlation, cranial, volume, ratio, due, early, elderly, sex, size, for, formation, function, give, hippocampus, impairment, intracranial, lateral, loss, measured, memory, mild, most, negative, or, other, per, per year, volume, role, see, sensitivity, severe, sensitivity, since, some, temporal, test, to, total, two, uncertain, use, use, variance, ventricular, when, with, year, memory"

"The ratio between plus- and minus-endÃdirected transport of mitochondria is altered by tau overexpression. Tau-stable and control cells were treated with nocodazole to disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton and to achieve an even distribution of mitochondria in both cell lines. The drug was washed out after 2 h of incubation and mitochondria were stained with MitoTrackerÂª Red. Translocations of the organelles were then recorded for 2 min with a time interval of 1 s. The direction of movement was regarded as plus-end directed when the organelles were transported to the periphery (1), minus- end directed when transport was towards the nucleus (2), and neutral (2/1) when movement was vertical to the axis between
nucleus and periphery of the cells. Note that the relative number of transported mitochondria is significantly lower for all three groups in the tau-stable cell line (P , 0.0001, two tailed StudentÃs t test). However, in tau-stable cells, the plus-endÃ directed movement is significantly more affected (z10-fold) than the reverse direction (2-fold). This leads to the phenotype of mitochondrial clustering.

"Effect of DSP4 treatment on plaque number. H6 male mice were chronically treated with DSP4 (5 mg/kg; beginning at age 3â4 months). After 6 months treatment (at age 8â9 months), serial sagital brain sections (separated by 210Âµm) were prepared from vehicle- and DSP4-treated mice (n = 6 each), stained using AÃ1-42 specific rabbit polyclonal antibody FCA3542 (Calbiochem; 1:1000 dilution), and visualized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and DAB.

"Domain structure of tau isoforms and constructs. Tau40 is the longest tau isoform in the human CNS, occurring mostly in axons (Goedert et al., 1989). It consists of 441 amino acid residues and can be divided into an NH2-terminal projection domain and a COOH-terminal microtubule binding domain containing four imperfect repeats (R1ÃR4) and basic proline-rich sequences on either side that act as microtubule targeting domains (shaded dark, P1, and P2). The repeats show high homology between tau, MAP2, and MAP4. The shaded NH2-terminal inserts and repeat two can be alternatively spliced, resulting in six different tau isoforms. The predominantly embryonic isoform tau23 lacks all three inserts (352 residues). Tau constructs K12 and K10 are derived from tau23, they contain three repeats plus either a COOHterminal flanking region (K12) or the whole COOH-terminal tail (K10).

The outline of the region began at the angle formed by the junction of the rhinal sulcus and the surface of the brain (the posterior end of this region may be continuous with the collateral sulcus in some subjects).

"3 series of z-stacks of confocal images of zebrafish embryos. One series is transmission, the other two series are fluorescence excited (alexa 488 and 568). The fluorescent dyes were associated with leukocytes in the zebrafish embryo. In these pictures you can see the head and part of the yolk of the embryo.

"A comparison of positron emission tomography images of cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with probable Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and
normal controls. The group with probable AD demonstrated significantly reduced rates of glucose metabolism (indicated in purple) bilaterally in the prefrontal (PF), parietal (Pa), temporal (Te), and posterior cingulate (PC) regions when compared with the control group.

"The ER organization is altered in CHO cells overexpressing tau. Tau40-stable (a and b) and mocktransfected CHO cells (c and d) were stained with DiOC6(3) to visualize the ER. In  tau-stable cells, the ER is less branched and does not reach the cell periphery, while in control cells the ER extends almost to the plasma membrane and displays a more complex structure.Note that, although the extension of the ER of the smaller cell in Fig. 11 b seems
to be less effected when compared with the larger cells, the branching and complexity of the endoplasmic reticulum is significantly reduced when compared with mocktransfected cells in c and d. The cell periphery is outlined for clarity.

"Transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-link  immunoreactivity in AD, control, and schizophrenic in superior orbital frontal cortex and cervical
spinal cord. Immunocytochemistry was performed on post mortem human brain tissue sections using antibody 81D4 against the Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl)
lysine cross-link. 
In post mortem superior frontal cortex (E), a significantly greater percentage of neurons exhibited immunoreactivity for Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl)
cross-linking using antibody 81D4 in the AD brain as compared with control brain (*P<0.05). Pooling of cases devoid of neurofibrillary pathology also results in a statistically significant difference between AD and pooled control and schizophrenic brain (**P<0.01). 
Data represent mean cell counts from six non-overlapping fields from two experiments. Neurological group means represent pooled data from AD (N=8), normal (N=3), and schizophrenic (N=7) patients. Numbers in bars indicate the total number of cells counted for statistical comparisons. In post mortem cervical spinal cord (F), we observe no differences in the percentage of neurons exhibiting immunoreactivity for Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl) cross-linking using antibody 81D4 in spinal cords from AD, control, or schizophrenic patients using an analysis of variance. Data represent mean cell counts from six non-overlapping fields from two experiments. Neurological group means represent pooled data from AD (N=8), normal (N=3), and schizophrenic (N=7) patients. Numbers in bars indicate the total number of cells counted for statistical comparisons.
